               increasingly long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of

               force fields used for such simulations and spurring efforts to
               refine these force fields. Recent modifications to the Amber and
               CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the
               backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier
               versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by
               improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the
               Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model
               alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose
               rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on
               Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain
               torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level
               quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used
               microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to
               validate the resulting force field against a large set of
               experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain
               conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber
               ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR

               across the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use the
               receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein
               to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
               receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2
               interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of
               SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction
               with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity than its
               binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1,
               the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the
               biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is
               unclear. This study utilizes combined single-molecule force
               spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation
               approaches to quantify the specific interactions between
               SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading
               rates, the unbinding forces between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range
               from 70 to 105 pN and are 30-40\% higher than those of SARS-CoV-1
               RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate
               that SARS-CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90
               of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the SARS-CoV-1
               RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra
               RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and
               prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by
               our experimental force spectroscopy study. After removing
               N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with
               SARS-CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the SARS-CoV-1
               RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism
               behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and
               SARS-CoV-1 and could help develop new strategies to block
               SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

               novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has become a global pandemic and
               its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine
               design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds
               the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter
               the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated,
               and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the
               interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these
               determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic
               strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom
               simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii)
               RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii)
               RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations
               identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form
               contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative
               evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably,
               we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by
               the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2
               interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we
               illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter
               specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the
               virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the
               glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding
               and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that
               MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2
               glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our
               results provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed
               interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed

               interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These
               bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for
               sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force
               probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of
               adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent
               properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of
               bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction
               kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested
               the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics)
               simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the
               force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests
               of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture
               forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond
               strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading
               rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading
               (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent
               enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the
               slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength
               grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial
               coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates,
               there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues
               to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many
               decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at
               ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular
               dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly
               overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked
               frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation.
               Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength,
               molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span
               of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the
               time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the
               extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a

               representative conformational distributions in simulation
               studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone,
               quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM)
               calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline
               dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined
               with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal
               and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine
               and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels,
               where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to
               available QM studies on these molecules. The
               LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides
               were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides.
               These improvements included additional parameter optimization via
               Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential
               energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral
               crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term.
               Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their
               crystalline environments were used to validate the force field
               enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed
               that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral
               parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were
               required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22
               force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of
               phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident.
               Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based
               energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these
               systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater
               deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded
               improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These
               improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in
               treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy
               function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of
               biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.",

               meaningful parameters for the height and location of the folding
               activation barrier. By comparing parameters obtained from pulling
               in different directions, we find that the unfolded state plays a
               dominant role in the refolding kinetics. Our findings explain why
               refolding becomes very slow at even moderate pulling forces and
               suggest how it could be practically observed in experiments at
               higher forces.",

               constructing widely used point charge water models. In contrast
               to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry

               ``optimal'' 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model (OPC) reproduces
               a comprehensive set of bulk properties significantly more
               accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error

               important compounds and the degradation of xenobiotics.
               Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida has provided a
               paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome P450s.
               However, the mechanism by which camphor, the natural substrate of
               cytochrome P450cam, accesses the buried active site is a
               long-standing puzzle. While there is recent crystallographic and
               simulation evidence for opening of a substrate-access channel in
               cytochrome P450BM-3, for cytochrome P450cam, no such
               conformational changes have been observed either in different
               crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations.
               Here, a novel simulation method, random expulsion molecular
               dynamics, is presented, in which substrate-exit channels from the
               buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly
               oriented force on the substrate, in addition to the standard
               molecular dynamics force field. The random expulsion molecular
               dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate-bound
               structure of cytochrome P450BM-3, and then applied to complexes
               of cytochrome P450cam with different substrates and with product.
               Three pathways were identified, one of which corresponds to a
               channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and
               site-directed mutagenesis data. Exit via the water-filled
               channel, which was previously suggested to be a product exit
               channel, was not observed. The pathways obtained by the random
               expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal
               motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic
               B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions (up to 4 A)
               observed in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid,
               passage of camphor through cytochrome P450cam only requires small
               backbone motions (less than 2.4 A) in conjunction with side-chain
               rotations. Concomitantly, in almost all the exit trajectories,
               salt-links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers
               between secondary structure elements of the protein, are

               model in a diffusion framework and subsequently use an equivalent
               flow to perform conformational sampling. To overcome the
               prohibitive cost of generalized all-atom modelling, we modularize
               the generation process and integrate a hypernetwork to predict

               thermostable limonene epoxide hydrolase variants obtained by
               computational library design were determined. Four different

               as rapid onset, fast wash out etc. The main limitations in wider

               spectropolarimetry (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry
               (DSC). The CD spectra for this dicyclic peptide indicate that it
               is monomeric, almost fully alpha-helical at -10 degrees C, and
               undergoes a reversible transition from the folded to the
               disordered state with increasing temperature. The temperature
               dependencies of the ellipticity at 222 nm and the excess heat
               capacity measured calorimetrically are well fit by a two-state
               model, which indicates a cooperative melting transition that is
               complete within the temperature ranges of these experiments (from
               -10 degrees C to 100 degrees C). This allows a complete analysis
               of the thermodynamics of helix formation. The helix unfolding is
               found to proceed with a small positive heat-capacity increment,
               consistent with the solvation of some non-polar groups upon helix
               unfolding. It follows that the hydrogen bonds are not the only
               factors responsible for the formation of the alpha-helix, and
               that hydrophobic interactions are also playing a role in its
               stabilization. At 30 degrees C, the calorimetric enthalpy and
               entropy values are estimated to be 650(+/-50) cal mol(-1)and
               2.0(+/-0.2) cal K(-1)mole(-1), respectively, per residue of this

               obtained for the unfolding of double-stranded alpha-helical
               coiled-coils shows that at that temperature the enthalpic
               contribution of non-polar groups to the stabilization of the
               alpha-helix is insignificant and the estimated transition
               enthalpy can be assigned to the hydrogen bonds. With increasing
               temperature, the increasing magnitude of the negative enthalpy of
               hydration of the exposed polar groups should decrease the
               helix-stabilizing enthalpy of the backbone hydrogen bonds.
               However, the helix-stabilizing negative entropy of hydration of
               these groups should also increase in magnitude with increasing

               organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is
               to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G*
               electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying
               electronic structure features, including formal charge and
               electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population
               charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then
               applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC
               charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting
               to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most
               organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as
               well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic
               heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the
               AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic
               compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database.
               Validation of the model was done through comparisons of
               hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of
               solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994
               Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer
               hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were
               reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab
               initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9
               kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated
               relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of
               monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol

               to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in

               topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small
               number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows
               a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure
               appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to
               form in the unfolded state.",

               steered molecular dynamics (SMD) in which the driving of the
               auxiliary ? viz steered ? particle is performed in stages. In
               SMD, many nonequilibrium trajectories are generated allowing for
               fast sampling of the ensemble space and access to rare events.
               Equilibrium observables, such as the potential of mean force
               along the pathway, result from averaging over these trajectories
               using Jarzynski's Equality (JE). Unfortunately, in SMD, a large
               number of trajectories are needed to cover all possible
               configurations in order to obtain converged quantities in the
               exponential average of the JE, and this is computationally
               expensive. ASMD reduces the number of trajectories that must be
               sampled by discarding those trajectories that have deviated far
               from the equilibrium path in stages. At the end of a stage, one
               chooses ? or contracts ? one (in naïve ASMD) or some (in
               multi-branched ASMD or MB-ASMD) of the configurations produced
               from the previous stage to initiate the trajectories in the next
               stage. Alternatively, in full-relaxation ASMD (FR-ASMD), all
               generated structures are relaxed under the constraint of a fixed
               auxiliary particle exerting no net work on the system. We provide
               a direct comparison of the energetics and other observables
               obtained from these approaches. We find that FR-ASMD is preferred
               when the unfolding pathways follow up along a single funnel and
               the system is sufficiently small that computational resources are
               not a limiting concern. It gives the highest accuracy in such
               cases while avoiding the inefficiencies of SMD. However, for
               complex energy landscapes typical of most multi-domain proteins,
               MB-ASMD is preferred because it provides a mechanism to sample
               alternative pathways while suffering only a modest loss in
               accuracy compared to FR-ASMD.",

               has been the extraction of information from such simulations that
               generalize for complex nonequilibrium processes. The use of
               Jarzynski's equality opened the possibility of determining the
               free energy along the steered coordinate, but sampling over the

               Here, we take advantage of these stages to address the numerical

               acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives

               first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect
               to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example,
               the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of

               technique to study biomolecular systems, which complements
               experiments by providing insights into the structural dynamics
               relevant to biological functions at atomic scale. It can also be
               used to calculate the free energy landscapes of the
               conformational transitions to better understand the functions of
               the biomolecules. However, the sampling of biomolecular
               configurations is limited by the free energy barriers that need
               to be overcome, leading to considerable gaps between the
               timescales reached by MD simulation and those governing
               biological processes. To address this issue, many enhanced
               sampling methodologies have been developed to increase the
               sampling efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations and free
               energy calculations. Usually, enhanced sampling algorithms can be
               classified into methods based on collective variables (CV-based)
               and approaches which do not require predefined CVs (CV-free). In
               this chapter, the theoretical basis of free energy estimation is
               briefly reviewed first, followed by the reviews of the most
               common CV-based and CV-free methods including the presentation of

               within the same framework, acceleration of rare events and
               estimation of the free energy of complex molecular systems. It is
               based on iteratively ‘filling’ the potential energy of the system
               by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a
               suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby
               forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The
               power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of
               extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope
               of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of
               these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.
               The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous
               alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the
               CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting
               estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted
               transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second
               scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should
               be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient
               or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using
               machine learning approaches. Metadynamics is a technique to
               enhance the probability of observing rare events, such as
               chemical reactions and phase transitions, in molecular dynamics
               simulations. This Technical Review surveys the technique,

               their extensive applications to biology and biochemistry. It is

               energy conversion in biological cells and the factors that
               stabilize proteins, nucleic acids, and cell membranes, the book

               rates of chemical reactions, how rates can help characterise the
               mechanism of a reaction, and how enzymes affect reaction rates. A
               third section, Biomolecular Structure, looks at how concepts of
               physical chemistry can be used to establish those 'rules' that
               govern the assembly of complex biological structures, while the

               metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the
               ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the
               ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding

               collections of small compounds in the target structure to

               candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the
               recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods
               for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces. RESULTS:
               Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on
               Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the
               publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is
               organised around a central library of functions, a basis for
               three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket
               identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection
               benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and
               (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of
               proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which

               pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying
               on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94\% and 92\% of
               the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo
               and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the
               field, while being faster. CONCLUSION: Fpocket provides a rapid,

               protein pocket detection, efficient pocket descriptor extraction,
               or drugablity prediction purposes. Fpocket is freely available

               presents a significant challenge to computer-aided drug design
               efforts. A striking example is provided by recent crystal
               structures of the p38 MAP kinase, where a 10A movement of the
               Phe169 side-chain creates a new binding site adjacent to the ATP
               binding site that is exploited by the diaryl urea inhibitor
               BIRB796. Here, we show that this binding site can be successfully
               and repeatedly identified in explicit-solvent molecular dynamics
               (MD) simulations of the protein that begin from an unliganded p38
               crystal structure. Ligand-docking calculations performed on 5000
               different structural snapshots generated during MD indicate that
               the conformations sampled are often surprisingly competent to
               bind the inhibitor BIRB796 in the crystallographically correct
               position and with docked energies that are generally more
               favorable than those of other positions. Similar docking studies
               with an ATP-binding site-directed inhibitor suggest that it may
               be possible to develop hybrid inhibitors that target both the ATP
               and cryptic binding sites simultaneously. Intriguingly, both
               inhibitors are occasionally found to dock correctly even with
               p38's ``DFG'' motif in the ``wrong'' conformation and BIRB796 can
               successfully dock, albeit infrequently, without significant
               displacement of the Phe169 side-chain; this suggests that the
               inhibitor might facilitate the latter's conformational change.
               Finally, two quite different conformations of p38's DFG motif are
               also sampled for extended periods of time during the simulations;
               these may provide new opportunities for inhibitor development.
               The MD simulations reported here, which total 390 ns in length,
               therefore demonstrate that existing computational methods may be
               of surprising utility in predicting cryptic binding sites in

               of self-avoiding random walk consisting of a cycle of
               local-minimum searches and transition state searches. The filling
               potential method is an umbrella potential sampling method, and
               enables the ligand molecule to drift from its local minima
               automatically. In the case of the filling potential method, the
               umbrella potential is a combination of Gaussian-type repulsive
               potentials, which are located on the trajectory of the ligand.
               Without setting the reaction coordinates a priori, this method
               searches for and determines the suitable reaction coordinates by
               successive generation of umbrella potentials based on its
               trajectory analysis. The weighted histogram analysis for these
               trajectories gives the binding free energy of the ligand to the

               structures for a set of proteins with validated cryptic sites,
               using the computational hot spot identification tool FTMap. The
               results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free structures
               generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As
               expected, regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average
               flexibility, and close to 50\% of the proteins studied here have
               unbound structures that could accommodate the ligand without
               clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each
               cryptic site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand,
               suggesting that binding may frequently involve an induced fit
               component. We additionally evaluated the structural basis for
               cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures.
               Cryptic sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound
               structure by intrusion of loops (22.5\%), side chains (19.4\%),
               or in some cases entire helices (5.4\%), but motions that create

               chains or loops (12\%) that are particularly evident in low

               cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of

               low affinity binding sites with limited use for drug discovery.",

               experimental quantity containing information about solute-solvent
               interactions and protein hydration. We use a hydration-shell
               model to partition the partial specific volume into an intrinsic
               volume occupied by the protein and a change in the volume
               occupied by the solvent resulting from the solvent interactions
               with the protein. We seek to extract microscopic information
               about protein hydration and unfolding from experimental volume
               measurements without using computer simulations. We employ the
               idea that the protein-solvent interaction will be proportional to
               the surface area of the protein. RESULTS: A linear relationship
               is obtained when the difference between the experimental protein
               partial specific volume and its intrinsic volume is plotted as a
               function of the protein solvent-accessible surface area. The
               effect of using different protein volume definitions on the
               analysis of protein volumetric properties is discussed.
               Volumetric data are used to test a model for the unfolded state
               of proteins and to make predictions about the denatured state.
               CONCLUSIONS: The linear relationship between hydration-shell
               volume change and accessible surface area reflects the similar
               surface properties (fractional composition of nonpolar, polar and
               charged surface) among a diverse set of proteins. This linear
               relationship is found to be independent of how the solution is
               partitioned into solute and solvent components. The
               interpretation of hydration shell versus bulk water properties is
               found to be very model dependent, however. The maximally exposed
               unfolded protein model is found to be inconsistent with
               experimental volume changes of unfolding.",

              and produces a free-energy landscape of the ligand-receptor
              binding by searching large-scale motions accompanied with stably
              keeping the fragile cell-membrane structure. All molecular
              components (bosentan, hETB, membrane, and solvent) were
              represented with an all-atom model, and sampling was carried out
              from conformations where bosentan was distant from the binding
              site in the hETB’s binding pocket. The deepest basin in the
              resultant free-energy landscape was assigned to the native-like
              complex conformation. The obtained binding mechanism is as
              follows. First, bosentan fluctuating randomly in solution is
              captured by a tip region of the flexible N-terminal tail of hETB
              via nonspecific attractive interactions (fly-casting). Bosentan
              then occasionally slides from the tip to root of the N-terminal
              tail (ligand–sliding). In this sliding, bosentan passes the gate
              of the binding pocket from outside to inside of the pocket with
              accompanying a quick reduction of the molecular orientational
              variety of bosentan (orientational selection). Last, in the
              pocket, ligand–receptor attractive native contacts are formed, and
              eventually the native-like complex is completed. The
              bosentan-captured conformations by the tip- and root-regions of
              the N-terminal tail correspond to two basins in the free-energy
              landscape, and the ligand–sliding corresponds to overcoming a
              free-energy barrier between the basins.",

               resolution using a two-edge (Se, Br) multiwavelength anomalous

               a member of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases

               (beta-Lg), the major whey protein in the milk of ruminants, bound
               retinol, the details of the binding have been controversial.
               beta-Lg is a lipocalin, like plasma retinol-binding protein, so
               that ligand association was expected to make use of the central
               cavity in the protein. However, an early crystallographic
               analysis and some of the more recent solution studies indicated
               binding elsewhere. We have now determined the crystal structures
               of the complexes of the trigonal form of beta-Lg at pH 7.5 with
               bound retinol (R=21.4\% for 7329 reflections between 20 and 2.4 A

               R(free)=29.8\%). Both ligands are found to occupy the central
               calyx in a manner similar to retinol binding in retinol-binding
               protein. We find no evidence of binding at the putative external
               binding site in either of these structural analyses. Further,
               competition between palmitic acid and retinol reveals only
               palmitate bound to the protein. An explanation is provided for
               the lack of ligand binding to the orthorhombic crystal form also

              existing vasculature, is a critical process during early
              development as well as in a number of disease processes. Tie2
              (also known as Tek) is an endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine
              kinase involved in both angiogenesis and vasculature maintenance.
              RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structure of the Tie2
              kinase domain to 2.2 A resolution. The structure contains the
              catalytic core, the kinase insert domain (KID), and the C-terminal
              tail. The overall fold is similar to that observed in other
              serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase structures; however, several
              unique features distinguish the Tie2 structure from those of other
              kinases. The Tie2 nucleotide binding loop is in an inhibitory
              conformation, which is not seen in other kinase structures, while
              its activation loop adopts an ``activated-like'' conformation in
              the absence of phosphorylation. Tyr-897, located in the N-terminal
              domain, may negatively regulate the activity of Tie2 by preventing
              dimerization of the kinase domains or by recruiting phosphatases
              when it is phosphorylated. CONCLUSION: Regulation of the kinase
              activity of Tie2 is a complex process. Conformational changes in
              the nucleotide binding loop, activation loop, C helix, and the
              C-terminal tail are required for ATP and substrate binding.",

              Trypsin-like serine protease domain and initiates the cascade of
              proteolytic events leading to Thrombin activation and blood clot
              formation. Vascular injury allows formation of the complex between
              circulating FVIIa and its cell surface bound obligate cofactor,
              Tissue Factor (TF). Circulating FVIIa is nominally activated but
              retains zymogen-like character and requires TF in order to
              complete the zymogen-to-enzyme transition. The manner in which TF
              exerts this effect is unclear. The structure of TF/FVIIa is known.
              Knowledge of the zymogen structure is helpful for understanding
              the activation transition in this system. RESULTS: The 2 A
              resolution crystal structure of a zymogen form of FVII comprising
              the EGF2 and protease domains is revealed in a complex with the
              exosite binding inhibitory peptide A-183 and a vacant active site.
              The activation domain, which includes the N terminus, differs in
              ways beyond those that are expected for zymogens in the Trypsin
              family. There are large differences in the TF binding region. An
              unprecedented 3 residue shift in registration between beta strands
              B2 and A2 in the C-terminal beta barrel and hydrogen bonds
              involving Glu154 provide new insight into conformational changes
              accompanying zymogen activation, TF binding, and enzymatic
              competence. CONCLUSIONS: TF-mediated allosteric control of the
              activity of FVIIa can be rationalized. The reregistering beta
              strand connects the TF binding region and the N-terminal region.
              The zymogen registration allows H bonds that prevent the N
              terminus from attaining a key salt bridge with the active site. TF
              binding may influence an equilibrium by selecting the
              enzymatically competent registration.",

              of cryptic sites utilizing the persistent homology method. This
              method integrates topological data analysis and mixed-solvent
              molecular dynamics (MSMD) simulations. To identify hotspots
              corresponding to cryptic sites, we conducted MSMD simulations
              using six probes with different chemical properties: benzene,
              isopropanol, phenol, imidazole, acetonitrile, and ethylene glycol.
              Subsequently, we applied our topological data analysis method to
              rank hotspots based on the possibility of harboring cryptic sites.
              Evaluation of CrypToth using nine target proteins containing
              well-defined cryptic sites revealed its superior performance

              favorable to ligand binding using MSMD simulations with six

              cryptic sites by assessing the protein’s conformational
              variability using the topological data analysis. This synergistic

              prediction is widely used in protein engineering and pathogenicity
              prediction, but training data scarcity remains a major challenge
              due to high costs of experimental measurements. A previous study
              proposed data augmentation using computational estimates by
              molecular simulation (1). However, this approach has been limited
              to predicting mutational effects on thermostability. Here, we
              present a new data augmentation method that combines molecular
              simulation with zero-shot prediction computed by protein language
              models. These computational estimates serve as “weak” training
              data to supplement experimental training data. Our method

              based on available experimental training data. This reduces

               and effective neutralizing antibody or drug molecule is still

               show that A6K peptides predominantly adopt loosely packed
               disordered coil aggregates, whereas V6K peptides mostly assemble
               into compact β-sheet-rich conformations, consistent with the
               signal measured experimentally in aqueous solution.
               Well-organized β-sheet-rich conformations, albeit with low
               population, are also populated for V6K octamers, including
               bilayer β-sheets and β-barrels. These ordered β-sheet-rich
               conformations are observed for the first time for amphiphilic
               peptides. Our 10-μs CG-MD simulations on 200 peptide chains
               demonstrate that A6K and V6K peptides follow two different
               self-assembly processes, and the former form monolayer lamellas
               while the latter assemble into plate-like assemblies. CG-MD
               simulations also show that V6K peptides display higher assembly
               capability than A6K, in support of our all-atom REMD simulation
               results. Interpeptide interaction analyses reveal that the marked
               differences in oligomeric structures and assembly dynamics
               between A6K and V6K result from the subtle interplay of
               competition among hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and
               electrostatic interactions of the two peptides. Our study
               provides structural and mechanistic insights into the initial
               self-assembly process of A6K and V6K at the molecular level.",

               in order to calculate the binding free energies of Xe, Kr and Ar
               relative to a standard state at a pressure of 1 bar. A single
               bound Xe is found to assume an equilibrium distribution over
               three adjacent preferred sites, while in a two-Xe complex, the
               two Xe atoms preferentially occupy two of these. The positions of

               determined in the refined crystal structure of a complex formed
               at a pressure of 8 bar Xe, and the calculated affinities agree
               well with the observed partial occupancies. At a pressure of 8
               bar, a mixture of one-Xe and two-Xe complexes is present, and

               leads to the conclusion that binding of Xe within cavities in

               has a large atomic polarizability; (2) Xe can be applied at a
               relatively high pressure, i.e. high chemical potential; (3) an
               unfavorable entropic term related to the need to orient the
               ligand in the binding site is absent. Finally, it is found that
               the model's binding energy of a water molecule in the cavity is

               T4 lysozymes in the presence of argon, krypton, and xenon. These
               proteins provide a representative sample of predominantly apolar
               cavities of varying size and shape. Even though the volumes of
               these cavities range up to the equivalent of five xenon atoms,
               the noble gases bind preferentially at highly localized sites
               that appear to be defined by constrictions in the walls of the
               cavities, coupled with the relatively large radii of the noble
               gases. The cavities within pseudo wild-type and L121A lysozymes
               each bind only a single atom of noble gas, while the cavities
               within mutants L133A and F153A have two independent binding
               sites, and the L99A cavity has three interacting sites. The
               binding of noble gases within two double mutants was studied to
               characterize the additivity of binding at such sites. In general,
               when a cavity in a protein is created by a ``large-to-small''
               substitution, the surrounding residues relax somewhat to reduce
               the volume of the cavity. The binding of xenon and, to a lesser
               degree, krypton and argon, tend to expand the volume of the
               cavity and to return it closer to what it would have been had no
               relaxation occurred. In nearly all cases, the extent of binding
               of the noble gases follows the trend xenon>krypton>argon.
               Pressure titrations of the L99A mutant have confirmed that the
               crystallographic occupancies accurately reflect fractional
               saturation of the binding sites. The trend in noble gas affinity
               can be understood in terms of the effects of size and
               polarizability on the intermolecular potential. The plasticity of
               the protein matrix permits repulsion due to increased ligand size
               to be more than compensated for by attraction due to increased
               ligand polarizability. These results have implications for the
               mechanism of general anesthesia, the migration of small ligands
               within proteins, the detection of water molecules within apolar
               cavities and the determination of crystallographic phases.",

               efforts to understand as well as rationally engineer living

               (AF2), hold promise for achieving this goal, but the practical
               utility of AF2 remains to be explored. Focusing on proteins with

                   decoration' (SCD) parameter. Consistent with random phase
                   approximation (RPA) theory and lattice simulations, LLPS
                   propensity as characterized by critical temperature $T^*_{\rm
                   cr}$ increases with increasingly negative SCD for a set of
                   sequences showing a positive correlation between $\kappa$ and
                   $-$SCD. Relative to RPA, the simulated sequence-dependent
                   variation in $T^*_{\rm cr}$ is often---though not
                   always---smaller, whereas the simulated critical volume
                   fractions are higher. However, for a set of sequences
                   exhibiting an anti-correlation between $\kappa$ and $-$SCD,
                   the simulated $T^*_{\rm cr}$'s are quite insensitive to
                   either parameters. Additionally, we find that blocky
                   sequences that allow for strong electrostatic repulsion can
                   lead to coexistence curves with upward concavity as
                   stipulated by RPA, but the LLPS propensity of a strictly
                   alternating charge sequence was likely overestimated by RPA
                   and lattice models because interchain stabilization of this
                   sequence requires spatial alignments that are difficult to
                   achieve in real space. These results help delineate the
                   utility and limitations of the charge pattern parameters and
                   of RPA, pointing to further efforts necessary for
                   rationalizing the newly observed subtleties.",

              conformations to an abstract low-dimensional space generates a

              independently to one another, computational sampling for the
              important process is difficult. Here, to sample such a process
              effectively, we developed a new method, named the
              ``multi-dimensional Virtual-system coupled Monte Carlo
              (multi-dimensional-VcMC)'' method, where the system interacts with
              a virtual system expressed by two or more virtual coordinates.
              Each virtual coordinate controls sampling along a reaction
              coordinate. By setting multiple reaction coordinates to be related
              to the corresponding rare events, sampling of the important
              process can be enhanced. An advantage of multi-dimensional-VcMC is
              its simplicity: Namely, the conformation moves widely in the
              multi-dimensional reaction coordinate space without knowledge of
              canonical distribution functions of the system. To examine the
              effectiveness of the algorithm, we introduced a toy model where
              two molecules (receptor and its ligand) bind and unbind to each
              other. The receptor has a deep binding pocket, to which the ligand
              enters for binding. Furthermore, a gate is set at the entrance of
              the pocket, and the gate is usually closed. Thus, the molecular
              binding takes place via the two events: ligand approach to the
              pocket and gate opening. In two-dimensional (2D)-VcMC, the two
              molecules exhibited repeated binding and unbinding, and an
              equilibrated distribution was obtained as expected. A conventional
              canonical simulation, which was 200 times longer than 2D-VcMC,
              failed in sampling the binding/unbinding effectively. The current
              method is applicable to various biological systems.",

               thermodynamically stable states (low-energy basins), which are
               connected by narrow conformational pathways (i.e., bottlenecks),
               the narrowness slows the inter-basin round trips in
               conformational sampling. This results in inaccuracy of free
               energies for the basins. This difficulty is not cleared out even
               when an enhanced conformational sampling is fairly performed
               along a reaction coordinate. In this study, to enhance the
               inter-basin round trips we introduced a virtual state that covers
               the narrow pathways. The probability distribution function for

               hole-size, a small inter-state transition probability produced a
               sampling efficiency 100 times higher than a conventional MC does.
               This result goes against ones intuition, because one considers
               generally that the sampling efficiency increases with increasing
               the transition probability. The present method is readily

               there are currently no data sources with sufficient breadth to
               parametrize generative models for conformational ensembles. To
               enable discovery, a fundamentally different approach to building
               generative models is required: models should be able to propose
               rare, albeit physical, conformations that may not arise in even

               reproduce relative residence times and reveal dissociation
               mechanisms and the effects of allosteric modulation for two
               important membrane-embedded drug targets: the β2-adrenergic
               receptor and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2. The
               dissociation mechanisms observed in the relatively short RAMD
               simulations (in which molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are
               performed using an additional force with an adaptively assigned
               random orientation applied to the ligand) are in general
               agreement with much more computationally intensive conventional
               MD and metadynamics simulations. Remarkably, although decreasing
               the magnitude of the random force generally reduces the number of
               egress routes observed, the ranking of ligands by dissociation
               rate is hardly affected and agrees well with experiment. The
               simulations also reproduce changes in residence time due to
               allosteric modulation and reveal associated changes in ligand

               biomacromolecules occurs over a wide range of timescales. For
               most pharmaceutically relevant inhibitors, these timescales are
               far beyond those that are accessible by conventional molecular
               dynamics (MD) simulation. Consequently, to explore ligand egress
               mechanisms and compute dissociation rates, it is necessary to
               enhance the sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD
               (RAMD) is a simple method to enhance ligand egress from a
               macromolecular binding site, which enables the exploration of
               ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction
               coordinates. Furthermore, the τRAMD procedure can be used to
               compute the relative residence times of ligands. When combined
               with a machine-learning analysis of protein-ligand interaction
               fingerprints (IFPs), molecular features that affect ligand
               unbinding kinetics can be identified. Here, we describe the
               implementation of RAMD in GROMACS 2020, which provides
               significantly improved computational performance, with scaling to
               large molecular systems. For the automated analysis of RAMD

               of IFPs along unbinding trajectories and for their use in the

               of ligand dissociation trajectories by mapping them onto the IFP

               optimization. For this purpose, computational methods to predict
               residence times, τ, for drug-like compounds and to derive
               structure-kinetic relationships are desirable. A challenge for
               approaches based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the
               fact that drug residence times are typically orders of magnitude
               longer than computationally feasible simulation times. Therefore,
               enhanced sampling methods are required. We recently reported one
               such approach: the τRAMD procedure for estimating relative
               residence times by performing a large number of random
               acceleration MD (RAMD) simulations in which ligand dissociation
               occurs in times of about a nanosecond due to the application of
               an additional randomly oriented force to the ligand. The length
               of the RAMD simulations is used to deduce τ. The RAMD simulations
               also provide information on ligand egress pathways and
               dissociation mechanisms. Here, we describe a machine learning
               approach to systematically analyze protein-ligand binding
               contacts in the RAMD trajectories in order to derive regression
               models for estimating τ and to decipher the molecular features
               leading to longer τ values. We demonstrate that the regression
               models built on the protein-ligand interaction fingerprints of
               the dissociation trajectories result in robust estimates of τ for
               a set of 94 drug-like inhibitors of heat shock protein 90
               (HSP90), even for the compounds for which the length of the RAMD
               trajectories does not provide a good estimation of τ. Thus, we
               find that machine learning helps to overcome inaccuracies in the
               modeling of protein-ligand complexes due to incomplete sampling
               or force field deficiencies. Moreover, the approach facilitates
               the identification of features important for residence time. In
               particular, we observed that interactions of the ligand with the
               sidechain of F138, which is located on the border between the ATP
               binding pocket and a hydrophobic transient sub-pocket, play a key
               role in slowing compound dissociation. We expect that the
               combination of the τRAMD simulation procedure with machine
               learning analysis will be generally applicable as an aid to
               target-based lead optimization.",

               dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice
               because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable
               simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an
               appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified

               for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways
               from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time.
               This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in
               explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction

               understanding many human diseases. Experimentally, proteins often
               appear to fold via simple two- or three-state mechanisms
               involving mainly native-state interactions, yet recent network
               models built from atomistic simulations of small proteins suggest
               the existence of many possible metastable states and folding
               pathways. We reconcile these two pictures in a combined
               experimental and simulation study of acyl-coenzyme A binding
               protein (ACBP), a two-state folder (folding time ~10 ms)
               exhibiting residual unfolded-state structure, and a putative
               early folding intermediate. Using single-molecule FRET in
               conjunction with side-chain mutagenesis, we first demonstrate
               that the denatured state of ACBP at near-zero denaturant is
               unusually compact and enriched in long-range structure that can
               be perturbed by discrete hydrophobic core mutations. We then
               employ ultrafast laminar-flow mixing experiments to study the
               folding kinetics of ACBP on the microsecond time scale. These
               studies, along with Trp-Cys quenching measurements of
               unfolded-state dynamics, suggest that unfolded-state structure
               forms on a surprisingly slow (~100 μs) time scale, and that
               sequence mutations strikingly perturb both time-resolved and
               equilibrium smFRET measurements in a similar way. A Markov state
               model (MSM) of the ACBP folding reaction, constructed from over
               30 ms of molecular dynamics trajectory data, predicts a complex
               network of metastable stables, residual unfolded-state structure,
               and kinetics consistent with experiment but no well-defined
               intermediate preceding the main folding barrier. Taken together,
               these experimental and simulation results suggest that the
               previously characterized fast kinetic phase is not due to
               formation of a barrier-limited intermediate but rather to a more
               heterogeneous and slow acquisition of unfolded-state structure.",

               macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and
               continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the
               performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study
               of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we
               explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD)
               simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute
               dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies
               predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions
               could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact
               on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always
               necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are
               quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this
               parameter should be carefully determined according to the
               characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3)
               Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD
               trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to
               achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of
               the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born
               (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and
               Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding
               affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the
               performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free
               energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in
               calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free
               energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency,
               MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where
               correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.",

               binding/unbinding events, it can thus be used to determine the
               molecular mechanism of binding between two molecules. We
               developed the McMD-based dynamic docking methodology based on the
               powerful, but woefully underutilized McMD algorithm, combined

               state as initial structure and using the other for a directing
               constraint. The method is exemplified with the T ↔ R transition
               of insulin. The most striking difference between these
               conformational states is that in T the 8 N-terminal residues of
               the B chain are arranged as an extended strand whereas in R they
               are forming a helix. Both the transition from T to R and from R
               to T were simulated. The method proves capable of finding a
               continuous pathway for each direction which are moderately
               different. The refolding processes are illustrated by a series of
               transient structures and pairs of Ø, ψ angles selected from the
               time course of the simulations. In the T → R direction the helix
               is formed in the →last third of the transition, while in the R →

               potential contribution are differences in the glycosylation of
               target human cells, particularly as SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity
               to bind sialic acid which is a common, and highly variable,

              function of biomolecules is, however, dependent on the range of
              conformations they can assume. This is especially true for
              peptides, a highly flexible class of molecules that are involved
              in numerous biological processes and are of high interest as
              therapeutics. Here, we introduce PepFlow, a generalized Boltzmann
              generator that enables direct all-atom sampling from the allowable
              conformational space of input peptides. We train the model in a
              diffusion framework and subsequently use an equivalent flow to
              perform conformational sampling. To overcome the prohibitive cost
              of generalized all-atom modelling, we modularize the generation
              process and integrate a hyper-network to predict sequence-specific
              network parameters. PepFlow accurately predicts peptide structures
              and effectively recapitulates experimental peptide ensembles at a
              fraction of the running time of traditional approaches. PepFlow
              can additionally be used to sample conformations that satisfy

                   distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly
                   injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that
                   transforms the prior distribution back into the data

                   can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks,

                   are not functions of a single molecular structure, but rather

                   Traditional methods for obtaining these distributions, such

              function, protein-protein interactions, as well as subcellular
              localization. Phosphorylation sites are preferably located in
              intrinsically disordered regions and have been shown to trigger
              structural rearrangements and order-to-disorder transitions. They
              can therefore have a significant effect on protein backbone
              dynamics or conformation, but only sparse experimental data are
              available. To obtain a more general description of how and when
              phosphorylations have a significant effect on protein behavior,
              molecular dynamics (MD) currently provides the only suitable
              framework to study these effects at a large scale in atomistic
              detail. This study develops a systematic MD simulation framework
              to explore the influence of phosphorylations on the local backbone
              dynamics and conformational propensities of proteins. Through a
              series of glycine-backbone peptides, we studied the effects of
              amino acid residues including the three most common
              phosphorylations (Ser, Thr, and Tyr), on local backbone dynamics
              and conformational propensities. We further extended our study to
              investigate the interactions of all such residues between position
              i to positions i+1, i+2, i+3, and i+4 in such peptides. The final
              dataset is comprised of structural ensembles for 3,393 sequences
              with more than 1 μs of sampling for each ensemble. To validate the
              relevance of the results, the structural and conformational
              properties extracted from the MD simulations are compared to NMR
              data from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank. The
              systematic nature of this study enables the projection of the
              gained knowledge onto any phosphorylation-site in the proteome and
              provides a general framework for the study of further PTMs. The
              full dataset is publicly available, as a training and reference

               28,000,000 infections and 900,000 deaths worldwide to date.
               Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the
               extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which
               mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting
               enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the
               SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host
               immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the
               glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed
               states, augmenting the available structural and biological data.
               Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics
               simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the
               roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We
               reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165
               and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike's
               receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2
               recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer
               interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these
               glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces
               binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift
               toward the ``down'' state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility
               analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of
               the glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be
               exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular
               machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional
               and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its
               glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational

               shown its ability to automatically characterize molecular

               Here, we introduce a guided-learning method suitable for networks
               of any size. The method employs a part of the weights for guiding

               this technique by predicting residue solvent accessibility and
               real-value backbone torsion angles of proteins. In this
               application, the guiding factor is designed to satisfy the
               intuitive condition that for most residues, the contribution of a
               residue to the structural properties of another residue is
               smaller for greater separation in the protein-sequence distance

               simulations in explicit solvent can provide an accurate model for
               biomolecules in solution, explicit solvent simulations are
               hampered by the slow equilibration on rugged landscapes
               containing multiple basins separated by barriers. In many cases,
               implicit solvent models can be used to significantly speed up the
               conformational sampling; however, implicit solvent simulations do
               not fully capture the effects of a molecular solvent, and this
               can lead to loss of accuracy in the estimated free energies. Here
               we introduce a new approach to compute free energy changes in

               retained while also taking advantage of the speed of the implicit

               free energy changes between basins in explicit solvent calculated

               From their X-ray structures, we saw that aromatic residues tended

               and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology
               has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the
               field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with
               the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning
               practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should
               balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express
               underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting
               spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models
               such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e.,
               interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be
               considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on
               test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about
               the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their
               relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the
               classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified
               performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the
               textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how
               increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation
               results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the
               existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of
               models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence.

               sites require a conformational change to become apparent; a
               cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that forms a
               pocket in a holo structure, but not in the apo structure. Because
               many proteins appear to lack druggable pockets, understanding and
               accurately identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug
               targets. Previously, cryptic sites were identified experimentally
               by fragment-based ligand discovery and computationally by long
               molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. Here, we
               begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo-holo
               pairs with cryptic sites. Next, we comprehensively characterize
               the cryptic sites in terms of their sequence, structure, and
               dynamics attributes. We find that cryptic sites tend to be as
               conserved in evolution as traditional binding pockets but are
               less hydrophobic and more flexible. Relying on this
               characterization, we use machine learning to predict cryptic
               sites with relatively high accuracy (for our benchmark, the true
               positive and false positive rates are 73\% and 29\%,

               covering 23\% of all residues in the proteome). CryptoSite
               increases the size of the potentially ``druggable'' human
               proteome from ~40\% to ~78\% of disease-associated proteins.
               Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach in practice,

               phosphatase 1B using a covalent ligand and NMR spectroscopy. The

               different quantities. The most popular one is the binding free
               energy, which can be estimated by several methods in conventional
               molecular dynamics simulation. So far in steered molecular
               dynamics (SMD), one can use either the rupture force or
               nonequilibrium pulling work as a measure for binding affinity. In
               this paper, we have shown that the nonequilibrium binding free
               energy Δ GneqJar, obtained by Jarzynski's equality at a finite
               pulling speed, has good correlation with experimental data on
               inhibition constants, implying that this quantity can be used as
               a good scoring function for binding affinity. A similar
               correlation has also been disclosed for binding and unbinding
               free energy barriers. Applying the SMD method to unbinding of 23
               small compounds from the binding site of β-lactamase protein, a

               equality, the rupture time depends on the unbinding barrier
               exponentially. We show that Δ GneqJar, the rupture time, and
               binding and unbinding free energy barriers are good descriptors
               for binding affinity. Our observation may be useful for fast
               screening of potential leads as the SMD simulation is not
               time-consuming. On the basis of nonequilibrium simulation, we
               disclosed that, in agreement with the experiment, the binding

               1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of
               protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces
               for nanosecond unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are
               needed to concertedly break a set of interstrand hydrogen bonds
               which protect the domains against unfolding through stretching;
               in the second case, stretching breaks backbone hydrogen bonds one
               by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose.
               Stretching of beta-sandwich (immunoglobulin) domains has been
               investigated further revealing a specific relationship between
               response to mechanical strain and the architecture of
               beta-sandwich domains.",

               structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54
               carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion
               (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration,

               avidin and streptavidin, achieving femtomolar and picomolar
               affinities, respectively. This is made even more exceptional
               because biotin achieves this with a meagre molecular weight of

               this are not in the standard repertoire of current medicinal

               nonclassical H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes. Most of

               that forms CH-π, CH-O, and classical H-bonds with the lipophilic
               region of the binding pocket. Biotin also utilizes an oxyanion

               streptavidin, mSA, corresponding to one subunit of wild type (wt)
               streptavidin tetramer. The monomer was designed by homology
               modeling, in which the streptavidin and rhizavidin sequences were
               combined to engineer a high affinity binding pocket containing
               residues from a single subunit only. Although mSA is stable and
               binds biotin with nanomolar affinity, its fast off rate (koff)
               creates practical challenges during applications. We obtained a
               1.9 Å crystal structure of mSA bound to biotin to understand
               their interaction in detail, and used the structure to introduce
               targeted mutations to improve its binding kinetics. To this end,
               we compared mSA to shwanavidin, which contains a hydrophobic lid
               containing F43 in the binding pocket and binds biotin tightly.
               However, the T48F mutation in mSA, which introduces a comparable
               hydrophobic lid, only resulted in a modest 20–40\% improvement in
               the measured koff. On the other hand, introducing the S25H
               mutation near the bicyclic ring of bound biotin increased the
               dissociation half life (t½) from 11 to 83 min at 20°C. Molecular
               dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that H25 stabilizes the binding
               loop L3,4 by interacting with A47, and protects key
               intermolecular hydrogen bonds by limiting solvent entry into the
               binding pocket. Concurrent T48F or T48W mutation clashes with H25
               and partially abrogates the beneficial effects of H25. Taken
               together, this study suggests that stabilization of the binding
               loop and solvation of the binding pocket are important
               determinants of the dissociation kinetics in mSA. Proteins 2013.

              escape a broad antibody to hemagglutinin's receptor-binding site
              the same way it escapes narrow strain-specific antibodies: via
              single mutations with huge effects. In contrast, broad antibodies
              to hemagglutinin's stalk only select mutations with small effects.
              Therefore, among the antibodies we examine, breadth is an
              imperfect indicator of the potential for viral escape via single
              mutations. Antibodies targeting the H1 hemagglutinin stalk are

               of researchers. The main idea of using SMD to screen out leads is
               based on the hypothesis that the larger is the force needed to
               unbind a ligand from a receptor the higher its binding affinity.
               Thus, instead of binding free energy, the rupture force defined

               and energetic details of intermolecular interactions in a simple
               experiment. A growing number of these studies have reported
               distinctly nonlinear trends in rupture force with loading rate
               that are typically explained in conventional models by invoking
               complex escape pathways. Recent analyses suggested that these
               trends should be expected even for simple barriers based on the
               basic assumptions of bond rupture dynamics and thus may represent
               the norm rather than the exception. Here we explore how these
               nonlinear trends reflect the two fundamental regimes of bond
               rupture: (i) a near-equilibrium regime, produced either by bond
               reforming in the case of a single bond or by asynchronized
               rupture of multiple individual bonds, and (ii) a kinetic regime
               produced by fast, non-equilibrium bond rupture. We analyze both
               single- and multi-bonded cases, describe the full evolution of
               the system as it transitions between near- and
               far-from-equilibrium loading regimes, and show that both
               interpretations produce essentially identical force spectra. Data
               from 10 different molecular systems show that this model provides
               a comprehensive description of force spectra for a diverse suite
               of bonds over experimentally relevant loading rates, removes the
               inconsistencies of previous interpretations of transition state
               distances, and gives ready access to both kinetic and
               thermodynamic information about the interaction. These results

               measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the

               lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model

                   models is that the generated molecules highly resemble those
                   in the training set. To generate truly novel molecules that
                   may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery,
                   more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary.
                   To this end, we propose Molecular Out-Of-distribution
                   Diffusion(MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that
                   incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the
                   generative stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simple
                   control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional
                   costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic
                   requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional
                   generation by utilizing the gradients from a property
                   predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to
                   high-scoring regions according to target properties such as
                   protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and

                   meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet

               While PCA is routinely applied to equilibrium molecular dynamics

               equilibrium and nonequilibrium data, and thus establishes a
               well-defined way to perform PCA on nonequilibrium data. While the
               resulting distribution P(x) and energy ΔG∝lnP will not reflect
               the equilibrium state of the system, the nonequilibrium energy
               landscape ΔG(x) may directly reveal the molecular reaction
               mechanism. Applied to targeted MD simulations of the unfolding of
               decaalanine, for example, a PCA performed on backbone dihedral
               angles is shown to discriminate several unfolding pathways.
               Although the formulation is in principle exact, its practical use
               depends critically on the choice of the biasing coordinate s,
               which should account for a naturally occurring motion between two
               well-defined end-states of the system.",

               simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in
               space in such a way to approximately represent the system's
               overall structure. In order that the simulations are not
               disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms
               from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances.
               Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a
               packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial
               constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the
               distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater
               than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to
               pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules,
               inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be
               intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes.
               The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each
               type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule
               must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating
               biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents,
               is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the
               same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial
               regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements
               can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing
               time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from
               a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input
               files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker,
               Molden, or Moldy coordinate files. The package is distributed as

               example, the prediction of pathways, rates and rate-limiting

               challenging in computational chemistry and biophysics. To address
               this challenge, we have developed a new computational method,
               ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), which
               selectively boosts the ligand nonbonded interaction potential
               energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics
               (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could
               be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system
               in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand
               binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and
               protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding
               and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in
               hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated
               guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental
               data with <1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged
               microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics
               simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD\_Dual simulations were
               also <1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate
               constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using
               Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture
               repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor
               in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding
               free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the
               experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a powerful
               enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding
               thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to
               facilitate computer-aided drug design.",

               an inhibitor is in complex with its target, is a fundamental part
               of the drug discovery process. Synthesis and experimental
               measurements of kinetic rate constants are, however, expensive
               and time consuming. In this work, we aimed to obtain drug
               residence times computationally. Furthermore, we propose a novel
               algorithm to identify molecular design objectives based on ligand
               unbinding kinetics. We designed an enhanced sampling technique to
               accurately predict the free-energy profiles of the ligand
               unbinding process, focusing on the free-energy barrier for
               unbinding. Our method first identifies unbinding paths
               determining a corresponding set of internal coordinates (ICs)
               that form contacts between the protein and the ligand; it then
               iteratively updates these interactions during a series of biased
               molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the ICs that are
               important for the whole of the unbinding process. Subsequently,
               we performed finite-temperature string simulations to obtain the
               free-energy barrier for unbinding using the set of ICs as a
               complex reaction coordinate. Importantly, we also aimed to enable
               the further design of drugs focusing on improved residence times.
               To this end, we developed a supervised machine learning (ML)
               approach with inputs from unbiased ``downhill'' trajectories
               initiated near the transition state (TS) ensemble of the string
               unbinding path. We demonstrate that our ML method can identify
               key ligand-protein interactions driving the system through the
               TS. Some of the most important drugs for cancer treatment are
               kinase inhibitors. One of these kinase targets is
               cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), an appealing target for
               anticancer drug development. Here, we tested our method using two
               different CDK2 inhibitors for the potential further development
               of these compounds. We compared the free-energy barriers obtained
               from our calculations with those observed in available
               experimental data. We highlighted important interactions at the
               distal ends of the ligands that can be targeted for improved
               residence times. Our method provides a new tool to determine
               unbinding rates and to identify key structural features of the
               inhibitors that can be used as starting points for novel design
               strategies in drug discovery.",

              associated with the motion of the flap region. To illustrate our
              overall workflow, we explored the free energy changes in the
              streptavidin/biotin system upon introducing conformational
              flexibility in loop3-4 in the biotin unbound ( apo) and bound (

               estimate the free energy of the binding of small ligands to
               biological macromolecules. They are typically based on molecular
               dynamics simulations of the receptor-ligand complex and are
               therefore intermediate in both accuracy and computational effort
               between empirical scoring and strict alchemical perturbation
               methods. They have been applied to a large number of systems with
               varying success. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the use of
               MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to calculate ligand-binding
               affinities, with an emphasis on calibration, testing and
               validation, as well as attempts to improve the methods, rather
               than on specific applications. EXPERT OPINION: MM/PBSA and
               MM/GBSA are attractive approaches owing to their modular nature
               and that they do not require calculations on a training set. They
               have been used successfully to reproduce and rationalize
               experimental findings and to improve the results of virtual
               screening and docking. However, they contain several crude and
               questionable approximations, for example, the lack of
               conformational entropy and information about the number and free
               energy of water molecules in the binding site. Moreover, there
               are many variants of the method and their performance varies
               strongly with the tested system. Likewise, most attempts to
               ameliorate the methods with more accurate approaches, for
               example, quantum-mechanical calculations, polarizable force
               fields or improved solvation have deteriorated the results.",

               analytical methods, although numerical methods and statistical

               presented. The goal is the development of techniques that are
               applicable to a wide variety of stochastic models that appear in
               physics, chemistry and other natural sciences. Applications such
               as stochastic resonance, Brownian motion in periodic potentials
               and Brownian motors are studied and the connection between
               diffusion processes and time-dependent statistical mechanics is
               elucidated.The book contains a large number of illustrations,
               examples, and exercises. It will be useful for graduate-level
               courses on stochastic processes for students in applied
               mathematics, physics and engineering. Many of the topics covered
               in this book (reversible diffusions, convergence to equilibrium

  abstract  = "The popular targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) method for
               generating transition paths in complex biomolecular systems is
               revisited. In a typical TMD transition path, the large-scale
               changes occur early and the small-scale changes tend to occur
               later. As a result, the order of events in the computed paths
               depends on the direction in which the simulations are performed.
               To identify the origin of this bias, and to propose a method in
               which the bias is absent, variants of TMD in the restraint
               formulation are introduced and applied to the complex open ↔
               closed transition in the protein calmodulin. Due to the global
               best-fit rotation that is typically part of the TMD method, the
               simulated system is guided implicitly along the lowest-frequency
               normal modes, until the large spatial scales associated with
               these modes are near the target conformation. The remaining
               portion of the transition is described progressively by
               higher-frequency modes, which correspond to smaller-scale
               rearrangements. A straightforward modification of TMD that avoids
               the global best-fit rotation is the locally restrained TMD
               (LRTMD) method, in which the biasing potential is constructed
               from a number of TMD potentials, each acting on a small connected
               portion of the protein sequence. With a uniform distribution of
               these elements, transition paths that lack the length-scale bias
               are obtained. Trajectories generated by steered MD in dihedral
               angle space (DSMD), a method that avoids best-fit rotations
               altogether, also lack the length-scale bias. To examine the
               importance of the paths generated by TMD, LRTMD, and DSMD in the
               actual transition, we use the finite-temperature string method to
               compute the free energy profile associated with a transition tube
               around a path generated by each algorithm. The free energy
               barriers associated with the paths are comparable, suggesting
               that transitions can occur along each route with similar
               probabilities. This result indicates that a broad ensemble of
               paths needs to be calculated to obtain a full description of
               conformational changes in biomolecules. The breadth of the
               contributing ensemble suggests that energetic barriers for
               conformational transitions in proteins are offset by entropic
               contributions that arise from a large number of possible paths.",

               are parallel to the mean force at every nonstationary point of
               the free energy landscape. In contrast to adiabatic paths, which
               are parallel to the force, OFEPs include the effect of entropy
               and are relevant even for systems with diffusive degrees of
               freedom. In this study the OFEPs are computed for the alanine
               dipeptide in solution. The potential of mean force is calculated
               and an effective potential is derived that is used to obtain the
               paths with a minimization based algorithm. The comparison of the
               calculated paths with the adiabatic paths in vacuo shows the
               influence of the environment on conformational transitions. The
               dynamics of the alanine dipeptide in water are more complex,
               since there are more minima and the barriers are lower. Two
               simpler methods for the calculation of reaction pathways in
               solution are evaluated by comparing their results with the OFEPs.
               In the first method the mean electrostatic field of the water is
               approximated by an analytical continuum model. The obtained paths
               show qualitative agreement with the OFEPs and the height of the
               barriers are similar. Targeted molecular dynamics (TMD), the
               second approach, constrains the distance to a target conformation
               to accelerate the transition. In the general case, however, it is
               difficult to assess the physical significance of the obtained
               paths. Changing the initial conditions by assigning different
               velocities leads to different solutions for the conformational
               transition. Furthermore, it is shown that by performing the
               simulations with different reaction coordinates or in opposite
               directions different pathways are preferred. This result can be
               explained by the structure of the free energy landscape around
               the initial conformations. In a first approximation the physical
               significance of different pathways is assumed to depend mainly on
               the free energy at the highest saddle point. In the literature
               the total energy of the system has often been used to estimate
               the position and the height of the energy barriers in the path.
               By comparing the total energy with the calculated free energy it
               is shown that the former largely overestimates the height of the
               barriers. Furthermore, the positions of the maxima of the total
               energy do not coincide with the free energy barriers. Simple
               approximations to the free energy lead to good quantitative
               agreement.",

               cooperativity of monomeric GK containing only a single binding
               site for glucose is very interesting and still unclear. The
               activation process of GK is associated with a large-scale
               conformational change from the inactive to the active state.
               Here, conventional and targeted molecular dynamics simulations
               were used to study the conformational dynamics of GK in the
               stable configurations and in the transition from active to
               inactive state. Three phases of the structural reorganization of
               GK were detected. The first step is a transformation of GK from
               the active state to the intermediate structure, where the cleft
               between the domains is open, but alpha helix 13 is still inside
               the small domain. From this point, there are two alternative
               paths. One path leads to the inactive state through the release
               of helix 13 from the inside of small domain to the outside. Other
               path goes back to the active state. Simulation results reveal the
               critical role of helix 13 in the transformation of GK from the
               open state to inactive one and the influence of the loop 2 on the

               states. Principal component analysis and covariance matrix

               conformations in vivo: (1) a monomeric form called the PP-fold in
               which a polyproline tail is folded onto an α-helix via a β-turn
               and (2) a dimeric form of the unfolded proteins in which the
               α-helices interact with each other via side chains. The
               transition pathway and rates between the two conformations remain
               unknown and are important to the nature of the binding of the
               protein. Toward addressing this question, the present work
               suggests that the unfolding of the PP-fold is too slow to play a
               role in NPY monomeric binding unless the receptor catalyzes it to
               do so. Specifically, the dynamics and structural changes of the
               unfolding of a monomeric NPY protein have been investigated in
               this work. Temperature accelerated molecular dynamics (MD)
               simulations at 500 K under constant (N,V,E) conditions suggests a
               hinge-like unraveling of the tail rather than a random unfolding.
               The free energetics of the proposed unfolding pathway have been
               described using an adaptive steered MD (SMD) approach at various
               temperatures. This approach generalizes the use of Jarzynski's
               equality through a series of stages that allows for better
               convergence along nonlinear and long-distance pathways. Results
               acquired using this approach provide a potential of mean force

              membrane-bound receptors to control processes such as food intake,
              vasoconstriction, and memory retention. The N-terminal polyproline
              sequence of NPY folds back onto a C-terminal α-helix to form a
              hairpin structure. The hairpin undergoes transient unfolding to
              allow the monomer to interact with its target membranes and
              receptors and to form reversible dimers in solution. Using
              computational, functional, and biophysical approaches, we
              characterized the role of two conserved tyrosines (Y20 and Y27)
              located within the hydrophobic core of the hairpin fold.
              Successive mutation of the tyrosines to more hydrophobic
              phenylalanines increased the thermal stability of NPY and reduced
              functional activity, consistent with computational studies
              predicting a more stable hairpin structure. However, mutant
              stability was high relative to wild-type: melting temperatures
              increased by approximately 20 °C for the single mutants (Y20F and
              Y27F) and by 30 °C for the double mutant (Y20F + Y27F). These
              findings suggested that the mutations were not just simply
              enhancing hairpin structure stability, but might also be driving
              self-association to dimer. Using analytical ultracentrifugation,
              we determined that the mutations indeed increased
              self-association, but shifted the equilibrium toward hexamer-like
              species. Notably, these latter species were not unique to the NPY
              mutants, but were found to preexist at low levels in the wild-type
              population. Collectively, the findings indicate that NPY
              self-association is more complex than previously recognized and
              that the ensemble of NPY quaternary states is tunable by
              modulating hairpin hydrophobicity.",

               wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies
               the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a
               variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM and
               CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and was
               developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based
               applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data
               analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data).
               ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available as
               a stand-alone application at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype and as
               a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype.
               FINDINGS: We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in three
               ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for standard
               amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for a large
               set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the structures
               for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB. CONCLUSIONS: ACPYPE
               is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology
               and parameters in different formats for different molecular
               mechanics programmes, including calculation of partial charges,
               while being object oriented for integration with other
               applications.",

               predictive value of features comprising epidemiology, evolution,
               immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling,
               and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2
               intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that ACE2-mediated
               transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity
               has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution
               over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area
               under the receiver operator characteristic curve,
               AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months
               in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. The behavior
               of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure
               wherein epidemiological covariates combine the effects of diverse
               and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to
               forecast mutations that will spread in the future and
               characterize how these mutations affect the binding of
               therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is
               possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in
               emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We validate this result
               against Omicron, showing elevated predictive scores for its
               component mutations prior to emergence, and rapid score increase
               across daily forecasts during emergence. This modeling approach
               may be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogens with
               sufficiently dense genomic surveillance data, such as influenza,
               and unknown future pandemic viruses.",

               programs. However, its in silico prediction has proven difficult.
               Here we describe a method, using atomistic ensemble-based steered

               from their target G protein-coupled receptor in a time scale

               accurately, precisely, and reproducibly identify ligand-residue

               capable of reconstructing equilibrium properties such as the
               Potential of Mean Force (PMF). Of course, one would like to use
               all types of force fields (FF) ranging from classical ones to
               more advanced polarizable models using point induced dipoles and
               distributed multipoles such as AMOEBA. To enable such studies,
               the SMD methodology has been implemented in the framework of the
               massively parallel Tinker-HP software allowing for both long
               polarizable and non-polarizable MD simulations of large proteins.
               To validate this new implementation, we first compared the
               Tinker-HP SMD results to the literature. Tests have been
               performed on three different benchmark systems: the M-A
               deca-alanine (112 atoms), the ubiquitin (9737 atoms), and the
               CD2CD58 complex (97594 atoms). Non-polarizable (AMBER99,
               AMBER99SB, CHARMM22/CMAP, and OPLS-AA/L) and polarizable
               (AMOEBAPRO13 and AMOEBABIO18) force fields have been used. For
               each one of them, PMFs have been reconstructed and compared in
               terms of free energy barrier and hydrogen bonding fluctuations
               behavior over time. Using a SMD velocity of 0.01 Å/ps applied to
               a set of 20 trajectories, we show that polarizable and
               non-polarizable force fields do not always agree. As it could be
               anticipated, strong discrepancies are noticed between polarizable
               and non-polarizable models when considered in vacuum, whereas
               results are more comparable when a water environment is added.
               However, for the largest system, i.e., the CD2CD58 complex,
               strong differences related to the modeling of a salt bridge are
               noticed exhibiting some potential issues with classical FFs.
               Overall, such simulations highlight the importance of the
               inclusion of polarization effects as PMF free energy barriers
               computed with AMOEBA always decrease compared to non-polarizable

              issues, including long QT syndromes (LQTS), congenital atrial
              fibrillation, and short QT syndrome. Off-target interactions of
              several drugs with that of KCNQ1/KCNE1 ion channel complex have
              been known to cause fatal cardiac irregularities. Thus,
              KCNQ1/KCNE1 remains an important avenue for drug-design and
              discovery research. In this work, we present the structural and
              mechanistic details of potassium ion permeation through an open
              KCNQ1 structural model using the combined molecular dynamics and
              steered molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the processes
              and key residues involved in the permeation of a potassium ion
              through the KCNQ1 ion channel, and how the ion permeation is
              affected by (i) the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interactions and (ii) the binding
              of chromanol 293B ligand and its derivatives into the complex. The
              results reveal that interactions between KCNQ1 with KCNE1 causes a
              pore constriction in the former, which in-turn forms small
              energetic barriers in the ion-permeation pathway. These findings
              correlate with the previous experimental reports that interactions
              of KCNE1 dramatically slows the activation of KCNQ1. Upon
              ligand-binding onto the complex, the energy-barriers along ion
              permeation path are more pronounced, as expected, therefore,
              requiring higher force in our steered-MD simulations.
              Nevertheless, pulling the ion when a weak blocker is bound to the
              channel does not necessitate high force in SMD. This indicates
              that our SMD simulations have been able to discern between strong
              and week blockers and reveal their influence on potassium ion
              permeation. The findings presented here will have some
              implications in understanding the potential off-target
              interactions of the drugs with the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel that lead

               computational method for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced
               sampling and free energy calculations of biomolecules. It works
               by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular
               potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly
               accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude.
               Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or
               collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced
               sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological
               processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian
               distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via
               cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., ``Gaussian
               approximation''). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free
               energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other
               enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica exchange GaMD
               (rex-GaMD) and replica exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS),
               have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free
               energy calculations. Recently, new ``selective GaMD'' algorithms
               including the ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD)
               enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive
               dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly
               flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient
               quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding
               thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its
               innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of
               biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational
               changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding,

               generating accurate free energy surfaces. Recently, many machine
               learning techniques have been developed to improve the quality of
               collective variables and the accuracy of free energy surfaces.
               Although machine learning has achieved great successes in
               improving enhanced sampling methods, there are still many
               challenges and open questions. In this perspective, we shall
               review recent developments on integrating machine learning
               techniques and collective variable-based enhanced sampling
               approaches. We also discuss challenges and future research

               high-dimensional free energy surfaces, and efficiently sampling
               all-atom configurations. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: © The Author(s), under

               dynamics (GA-mD-VcMD) simulation was conducted to elucidate
               binding mechanisms of a middle-sized flexible molecule, bosentan,
               to a GPCR protein, human endothelin receptor type B (hETB).
               GA-mD-VcMD is a generalized ensemble method that produces a
               free-energy landscape of the ligand-receptor binding by searching
               large-scale motions accompanied with stable maintenance of the
               fragile cell-membrane structure. All molecular components
               (bosentan, hETB, membrane, and solvent) were represented with an
               all-atom model. Then sampling was conducted from conformations
               where bosentan was distant from the binding site in the hETB
               binding pocket. The deepest basin in the resultant free-energy
               landscape was assigned to native-like complex conformation. The
               following binding mechanism was inferred. First, bosentan
               fluctuating randomly in solution is captured using a tip region
               of the flexible N-terminal tail of hETB via nonspecific
               attractive interactions (fly casting). Bosentan then slides
               occasionally from the tip to the root of the N-terminal tail
               (ligand-sliding). During this sliding, bosentan passes the gate
               of the binding pocket from outside to inside of the pocket with
               an accompanying rapid reduction of the molecular orientational
               variety of bosentan (orientational selection). Last, in the
               pocket, ligand-receptor attractive native contacts are formed.
               Eventually, the native-like complex is completed. The
               bosentan-captured conformations by the tip-region and root-region
               of the N-terminal tail correspond to two basins in the
               free-energy landscape. The ligand-sliding corresponds to
               overcoming of a free-energy barrier between the basins.",

               in some sense describe the essential dynamics of the system.
               Considering the distribution P(x) of the CVs, the primal goal of
               a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic features
               of P(x), in particular, its maxima and their connection paths.
               This is because these features characterize the low-energy
               regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding free energy
               landscape ΔG(x) = −kBT ln P(x), and therefore amount to the
               metastable states and transition regions of the system. In this

               component analysis), and perform density based (rather than

               rigorous selection of MDM2-binding peptides by means of mRNA
               display and identified an optimal 12-mer peptide (PRFWEYWLRLME),
               named MDM2 Inhibitory Peptide (MIP), which shows higher affinity
               for MDM2 (and also its homolog, MDMX) and higher tumor cell
               proliferation suppression activity than known peptides. Here we
               determined the NMR solution structure of a MIP-MDM2 fusion
               protein to elucidate the structural basis of the tight binding of
               MIP to MDM2. A region spanning from Phe3 to Met11 of MIP forms a

               hydrophobic pockets of MDM2. Additionally, hydrophobic surface
               patches that surround the hydrophobic pockets of MDM2 are covered
               by solvent-exposed MIP residues, Trp4, Tyr6, and Met11. Their
               hydrophobic interactions extend the interface of the two
               molecules and contribute to the strong binding. The potential

               Computational models for interpreting the quantitative
               structure-kinetics relationship (QSKR) aim at predicting
               protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics based on protein
               structure, ligand structure, or their complex structure, which in
               principle can provide a more rational basis for structure-based
               drug design. Thus far, most of the public data sets used for
               deriving such QSKR models are rather limited in sample size and
               structural diversity. To tackle this problem, we have compiled a
               set of 680 protein-ligand complexes with experimental
               dissociation rate constants (k off), which were mainly curated
               from the references accumulated for updating our PDBbind
               database. Three-dimensional structure of each protein-ligand
               complex in this data set was either retrieved from the Protein
               Data Bank or carefully modeled based on a proper template. The
               entire data set covers 155 types of protein, with their
               dissociation kinetic constants (k off) spanning nearly 10 orders
               of magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, this data set is the
               largest of its kind reported publicly. Utilizing this data set,
               we derived a random forest (RF) model based on protein-ligand
               atom pair descriptors for predicting k off values. We also
               demonstrated that utilizing modeled structures as additional

               with mixed structures can serve as a baseline for testifying

               Cl(-), Br(-), and I(-)) ions play an important role in many
               biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of
               biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to
               key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To
               properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic
               simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding,
               catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of
               the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs
               to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including
               their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the
               interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in
               solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At
               present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple
               additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic
               interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build
               better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise
               Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are
               tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald
               simulations with specific choices of well-known water models.
               Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate
               treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and
               polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even
               a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the
               limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model
               could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be
               extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our
               starting point centered on observations from long simulations of
               biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where
               salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The
               likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to
               the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with
               AMBER-adapted Aqvist cation parameters. To provide a more
               appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the
               Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of
               water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we
               calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also
               lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide
               salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans
               across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while
               balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair
               combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization
               across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations.
               The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were
               targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and
               nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4P EW, and
               SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal
               properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding
               energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first
               hydration shells.",

               function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific
               sequence or in different sequences. However, systematic
               high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an
               entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an
               extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green
               fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring
               the native function (fluorescence) of tens of thousands of
               derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness landscape
               of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single
               mutation showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives
               with four mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The
               narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to
               30\% of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly occurred
               through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations
               causing a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a
               concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence

               disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in
               better agreement with experiment. These results represent a

              molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides,
              lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands,
              as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments.
              For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite
              of computational tools that include numerous conformational and
              path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular
              minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and
              model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to
              problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems.
              Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of
              different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum
              mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom

               the enhanced conformational sampling of a simple system and shows
               that reasonably well-controlled sampling slows the transitions.
               This slowing is induced by a rapid change of entropy along the
               reaction coordinate. We then provide a recipe to speed up the

               site prediction for enhancing the regioselectivity of substrate

               can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function.
               Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of
               around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
               represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
               sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months
               to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
               protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
               to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
               bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a
               protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the
               structure prediction component of the 'protein folding
               problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more
               than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods
               fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous
               structure is available. Here we provide the first computational
               method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic
               accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
               validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural
               network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical
               Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15,
               demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures
               in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.
               Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine
               learning approach that incorporates physical and biological
               knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence

               AlphaFold, a deep learning-based approach to protein structure
               prediction, shows remarkable success in independent assessments
               of prediction accuracy. A significant epoch in structural
               bioinformatics was the structural annotation of over 98\% of
               protein sequences in the human proteome. Interestingly, many
               predictions feature regions of very low confidence, and these
               regions largely overlap with intrinsically disordered regions
               (IDRs). That over 30\% of regions within the proteome are
               disordered is congruent with estimates that have been made over
               the past two decades, as intense efforts have been undertaken to
               generalize the structure-function paradigm to include the
               importance of conformational heterogeneity and dynamics. With
               structural annotations from AlphaFold in hand, there is the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Although structural domains in proteins (SDs) are
               important, half of the regions in the human proteome are
               currently left with no SD assignments. These unassigned regions
               consist not only of novel SDs, but also of intrinsically
               disordered (ID) regions since proteins, especially those in
               eukaryotes, generally contain a significant fraction of ID
               regions. As ID regions can be inferred from amino acid sequences,
               a method that combines SD and ID region assignments can determine
               the fractions of SDs and ID regions in any proteome. RESULTS: In
               contrast to other available ID prediction programs that merely
               identify likely ID regions, the DICHOT system we previously
               developed classifies the entire protein sequence into SDs and ID
               regions. Application of DICHOT to the human proteome revealed
               that residue-wise ID regions constitute 35\%, SDs with similarity
               to PDB structures comprise 52\%, while SDs with no similarity to
               PDB structures account for the remaining 13\%. The last group
               consists of novel structural domains, termed cryptic domains,
               which serve as good targets of structural genomics. The DICHOT
               method applied to the proteomes of other model organisms
               indicated that eukaryotes generally have high ID contents, while
               prokaryotes do not. In human proteins, ID contents differ among
               subcellular localizations: nuclear proteins had the highest
               residue-wise ID fraction (47\%), while mitochondrial proteins
               exhibited the lowest (13\%). Phosphorylation and O-linked
               glycosylation sites were found to be located preferentially in ID
               regions. As O-linked glycans are attached to residues in the
               extracellular regions of proteins, the modification is likely to
               protect the ID regions from proteolytic cleavage in the
               extracellular environment. Alternative splicing events tend to
               occur more frequently in ID regions. We interpret this as
               evidence that natural selection is operating at the protein level
               in alternative splicing. CONCLUSIONS: We classified entire
               regions of proteins into the two categories, SDs and ID regions
               and thereby obtained various kinds of complete genome-wide
               statistics. The results of the present study are important basic

               First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate
               the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and
               appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second,
               rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating
               only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue
               pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score.
               For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed
               a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small
               to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR\_3

               represents the first required step for cellular entry. SARS-CoV-2
               has continued to evolve with the emergence of several novel
               variants, and amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated
               with increased fitness and potential for immune evasion. Reliably
               predicting the effect of amino acid changes on the ability of the

               implications for public health and the potential for spillover
               and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step
               framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular
               dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect

               predict binding affinity changes using the decomposed energy

               substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving
               binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.73

                   subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
                   lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes.

                   evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for

                   crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model
                   that takes high-level natural language as input and generates
                   intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g.,
                   chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes
                   intermediate information as input and generates low-level
                   continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses
                   a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation
                   energy) from the generated crystal structures. During
                   inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a
                   forward tree search over the space of possible structures.
                   Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of
                   directly using language models to generate structures both in
                   satisfying user request and in generating low-energy
                   structures. We confirm that GenMS is able to generate common
                   crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels,
                   solely from natural language input, and hence can form the
                   foundation for more complex structure generation in near
                   future.",

               and can pose a significant challenge in the identification of
               potential binding sites. Cryptic binding sites have been defined
               as sites which require significant rearrangement of the protein
               structure to become physically accessible to a ligand.
               Mixed-solvent MD (MixMD) is a computational protocol which maps
               the surface of the protein using molecular dynamics (MD) of the
               unbound protein solvated in a 5\% box of probe molecules with
               explicit water. This method has successfully identified known
               active and allosteric sites which did not require reorganization.
               In this study, we apply the MixMD protocol to identify known
               cryptic sites of 12 proteins characterized by a wide range of
               conformational changes. Of these 12 proteins, three require
               reorganization of side chains, five require loop movements, and
               four require movement of more significant structures such as
               whole helices. In five cases, we find that standard MixMD
               simulations are able to map the cryptic binding sites with at
               least one probe type. In two cases (guanylate kinase and TIE-2),
               accelerated MD, which increases sampling of torsional angles, was
               necessary to achieve mapping of portions of the cryptic binding
               site missed by standard MixMD. For more complex systems where
               movement of a helix or domain is necessary, MixMD was unable to
               map the binding site even with accelerated dynamics, possibly due
               to the limited timescale (100 ns for individual simulations). In
               general, similar conformational dynamics are observed in
               water-only simulations and those with probe molecules. This could
               imply that the probes are not driving opening events but rather
               take advantage of mapping sites that spontaneously open as part
               of their inherent conformational behavior. Finally, we show that
               docking to an ensemble of conformations from the standard MixMD
               simulations performs better than docking the apo crystal
               structure in nine cases and even better than half of the bound
               crystal structures. Poorer performance was seen in docking to
               ensembles of conformations from the accelerated MixMD

               However, cryptic pocket openings are often beyond the reach of
               conventional biomolecular simulations because certain cryptic
               pocket openings involve slow motions. Here, we investigate
               whether AlphaFold can be used to accelerate cryptic pocket
               discovery either by generating structures with open pockets
               directly or generating structures with partially open pockets
               that can be used as starting points for simulations. We use
               AlphaFold to generate ensembles for 10 known cryptic pocket
               examples, including five that were deposited after AlphaFold's
               training data were extracted from the PDB. We find that in 6 out
               of 10 cases AlphaFold samples the open state. For plasmepsin II,
               an aspartic protease from the causative agent of malaria,
               AlphaFold only captures a partial pocket opening. As a result, we
               ran simulations from an ensemble of AlphaFold-generated
               structures and show that this strategy samples cryptic pocket
               opening, even though an equivalent amount of simulations launched
               from a ligand-free experimental structure fails to do so. Markov
               state models (MSMs) constructed from the AlphaFold-seeded
               simulations quickly yield a free energy landscape of cryptic
               pocket opening that is in good agreement with the same landscape
               generated with well-tempered metadynamics. Taken together, our
               results demonstrate that AlphaFold has a useful role to play in
               cryptic pocket discovery but that many cryptic pockets may remain

               NH equation, the heat-bath temperature is a dynamical variable.
               The temperature fluctuations are not ad hoc, but instead are
               generated by the newly defined temperature system, and the
               statistical distribution of the temperature is completely

                   learning approaches, especially with deep generative models.
                   Inspired by the diffusion process in classical
                   non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will
                   diffuse from original states to a noise distribution, in this
                   paper, we propose a novel generative model named GeoDiff for
                   molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff treats each atom
                   as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion
                   process (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to
                   stable conformations) as a Markov chain. Modeling such a
                   generation process is however very challenging as the
                   likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational
                   invariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving
                   with equivariant Markov kernels can induce an invariant
                   distribution by design, and further propose building blocks
                   for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable equivariance
                   property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in
                   an end-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational
                   lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood. Experiments on

                   timesteps on the order of femtoseconds
                   ($1\textrm{fs}=10^{-15}\textrm{s}$). MD is often used to
                   compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling from
                   an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann
                   distribution. However, many important processes, such as
                   binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds or
                   beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with conventional
                   MD. Furthermore, new MD simulations need to be performed for
                   each molecular system studied. We present Timewarp, an

                   simulating complex atomistic systems from first principles.
                   Recently deep learning models become a popular way to
                   accelerate MD. Notwithstanding, existing models depend on
                   intermediate variables such as the potential energy or force
                   fields to update atomic positions, which requires additional
                   computations to perform back-propagation. To waive this
                   requirement, we propose a novel model called DiffMD by
                   directly estimating the gradient of the log density of
                   molecular conformations. DiffMD relies on a score-based
                   denoising diffusion generative model that perturbs the
                   molecular structure with a conditional noise depending on
                   atomic accelerations and treats conformations at previous
                   timeframes as the prior distribution for sampling. Another
                   challenge of modeling such a conformation generation process
                   is that a molecule is kinetic instead of static, which no
                   prior works have strictly studied. To solve this challenge,
                   we propose an equivariant geometric Transformer as the score
                   function in the diffusion process to calculate corresponding
                   gradients. It incorporates the directions and velocities of
                   atomic motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel
                   representations. With multiple architectural improvements, we

               SMLM resolution goes beyond the diffraction limit of light
               microscopy and achieves resolution on the order of 10-20 nm. SMLM
               thus enables imaging single molecules and study of the low-level
               molecular interactions at the subcellular level. In contrast to
               standard microscopy imaging that produces 2D pixel or 3D voxel
               grid data, SMLM generates big data of 2D or 3D point clouds with
               millions of localizations and associated uncertainties. This
               unprecedented breakthrough in imaging helps researchers employ
               SMLM in many fields within biology and medicine, such as studying
               cancerous cells and cell-mediated immunity and accelerating drug

               of view versus region of interest, use of machine-learning and
               multi-scale analysis, biosignature extraction, etc.). We observe

               developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of
               choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies
               to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we
               present a few recent representative applications, which we have
               classified into three main classes: solid‐state physics, chemical
               reactions, and biomolecules. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

               with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presenting a
               peptide (p). Two TCR-pMHC complexes are considered, which only
               differ by the mutation of a single amino acid on the peptide; one
               is a strong agonist that produces T cell activation in vivo,
               while the other is an antagonist. We investigate the interaction
               mechanism from a large number of unbinding trajectories by
               analyzing van der Waals and electrostatic interactions and by
               computing energy changes in proteins and solvent. In addition,

                   assumption has several high-dimensional limitations,
                   motivating a more concrete route toward even higher dimension

                   extending the theory to a broader family of noising

                   To theoretically ground this, we relax a key assumption in
                   (denoising) score matching theory, demonstrating that
                   distributions which are differentiable almost everywhere

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Molecular docking studies on protein-peptide
               interactions are a challenging and time-consuming task because
               peptides are generally more flexible than proteins and tend to
               adopt numerous conformations. There are several benchmarking
               studies on protein-protein, protein-ligand and nucleic
               acid-ligand docking interactions. However, a series of docking
               methods is not rigorously validated for protein-peptide complexes
               in the literature. Considering the importance and wide
               application of peptide docking, we describe benchmarking of 6
               docking methods on 133 protein-peptide complexes having peptide
               length between 9 to 15 residues. The performance of docking
               methods was evaluated using CAPRI parameters like FNAT, I-RMSD,
               L-RMSD. RESULT: Firstly, we performed blind docking and evaluate
               the performance of the top docking pose of each method. It was
               observed that FRODOCK performed better than other methods with
               average L-RMSD of 12.46 Å. The performance of all methods
               improved significantly for their best docking pose and achieved
               highest average L-RMSD of 3.72 Å in case of FRODOCK. Similarly,
               we performed re-docking and evaluated the performance of the top
               and best docking pose of each method. We achieved the best
               performance in case of ZDOCK with average L-RMSD 8.60 Å and 2.88
               Å for the top and best docking pose respectively. Methods were
               also evaluated on 40 protein-peptide complexes used in the
               previous benchmarking study, where peptide have length up to 5
               residues. In case of best docking pose, we achieved the highest
               average L-RMSD of 4.45 Å and 2.09 Å for the blind docking using
               FRODOCK and re-docking using AutoDock Vina respectively.
               CONCLUSION: The study shows that FRODOCK performed best in case
               of blind docking and ZDOCK in case of re-docking. There is a need
               to improve the ranking of docking pose generated by different
               methods, as the present ranking scheme is not satisfactory. To
               facilitate the scientific community for calculating CAPRI

               truncated random walks to learn latent representations by
               treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate
               DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network

               challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the
               network, especially in the presence of missing information.
               DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10\%

               some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to

               learning technique that allows for greater flexibility,
               adaptability, dynamism, faster training, information sharing, and
               model compression. Hypernets have shown promising results in a

               target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to
               its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known
               allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in
               functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP
               hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the
               nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative
               nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an
               advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active
               GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules
               that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C).
               These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and

               switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C)
               disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native

               of the approaches toward the analysis of complex temporal data
               which has found applications in the fields of neuroscience and
               econometrics is Granger causality analysis. It allows determining
               which components of multidimensional time series are most
               influential for the evolution of the entire system, thus
               providing insights into causal relations within the dynamic
               structure of interest. In this work, we apply Granger analysis to
               a long molecular dynamics trajectory depicting repetitive folding
               and unfolding of a mini β-hairpin protein, CLN025. We find
               objective, quantitative evidence indicating that rearrangements

               folding and unfolding. On the contrary, interactions between

               these findings clearly favor the concept of zipperlike folding,

                   particles is typically the most time-consuming task in
                   particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward
                   implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have
                   traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually
                   do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach
                   high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures,
                   single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has
                   become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also
                   increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of
                   memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only
                   interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD
                   utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and
                   output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we
                   present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on
                   grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into
                   spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between
                   particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse
                   compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more
                   efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size
                   allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths.
                   This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient
                   implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures
                   like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm
                   future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to
                   molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of

               conformational dynamics of IDPs could help to elucidate their
               roles in health and disease. However, the inherent flexibility of
               IDPs makes structural studies and their interpretation
               challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could address
               this challenge in principle, but inaccuracies in the simulation
               models and the need for long simulations have stymied progress.
               To overcome these limitations, we adopt a hierarchical approach
               that builds on the ``flexible-meccano'' model reported by Bernadó
               et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 17968-17969). First, we
               exhaustively sample small IDP fragments in all-atom simulations
               to capture their local structures. Then, we assemble the
               fragments into full-length IDPs to explore the stereochemically
               possible global structures of IDPs. The resulting ensembles of
               three-dimensional structures of full-length IDPs are highly
               diverse, much more so than in standard MD simulation. For the
               paradigmatic IDP α-synuclein, our ensemble captures both the
               local structure, as probed by nuclear magnetic resonance
               spectroscopy, and its overall dimension, as obtained from
               small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. By generating
               representative and meaningful starting ensembles, we can begin to
               exploit the massive parallelism afforded by current and future

               disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug
               discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging,
               however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI
               interfaces are ``cryptic'': When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic
               sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily
               recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and
               chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites

               molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better
               understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To
               this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of
               the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three
               SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)-which performs its

               multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable
               binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a
               protein-small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical
               to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the
               IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the
               IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound

               binding sites play a crucial role in various domains, from
               fundamental research to biomedical applications. However, current
               prediction methodologies often rely on holo (ligand-bound)
               protein conformations for training and evaluation, overlooking
               the significance of the apo (ligand-free) states. This oversight
               is particularly problematic in the case of cryptic binding sites
               (CBSs) where holo-based assessment yields unrealistic performance
               expectations. RESULTS: To advance the development in this domain,
               we introduce CryptoBench, a benchmark dataset tailored for
               training and evaluating novel CBS prediction methodologies.
               CryptoBench is constructed upon a large collection of apo-holo
               protein pairs, grouped by UniProtID, clustered by sequence
               identity, and filtered to contain only structures with
               substantial structural change in the binding site. CryptoBench
               comprises 1107 structures with predefined cross-validation
               splits, making it the most extensive CBS dataset to date. To
               establish a performance baseline, we measured the predictive
               power of sequence- and structure-based CBS residue prediction
               methods using the benchmark. We selected PocketMiner as the
               state-of-the-art representative of the structure-based methods
               for CBS detection, and P2Rank, a widely-used structure-based
               method for general binding site prediction that is not
               specifically tailored for cryptic sites. For sequence-based
               approaches, we trained a neural network to classify binding
               residues using protein language model embeddings. Our
               sequence-based approach outperformed PocketMiner and P2Rank
               across key metrics, including area under the curve, area under
               the precision-recall curve, Matthew's correlation coefficient,
               and F1 scores. These results provide baseline benchmark results
               for future CBS and potentially also non-CBS prediction endeavors,
               leveraging CryptoBench as the foundational platform for further
               advancements in the field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The
               CryptoBench dataset, including the benchmark model, is available

               binding sites are conserved in variants of a protein. For
               example, before an allosteric cryptic pocket was discovered, KRAS
               was considered undruggable due to its smooth surface and
               conservation of the GDP/GTP binding pocket across the wild type

               theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety
               of physically different metastable potential configurations is
               elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique.
               Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems
               exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary
               nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures,

               mechanisms driving these preferences remain unresolved. In this
               work, we show that the distributions of atomic overlaps between

               distribution functions of both the crystalline and melt

               at 2.0 Å resolution complexed with hirugen. The structure has
               been refined to a final R‐value of 0.169 using 14,211 observed
               reflections in the resolution range 8.0–2.0 Å. A total of 202
               water molecules have also been located in the structure.
               Comparison with the hirugen–thrombin complex showed that, apart
               from the flexible beginning and terminal regions of the molecule,
               there are 4 polypeptide segments in pre2 differing in
               conformation from the active enzyme (Pro 186–Asp 194, Gly 216–Gly
               223, Gly 142–Pro 152, and the Arg 15–Ile 16 cleavage region). The
               formation of the Ile 16–Asp 194 ion pair and the specificity
               pocket are characteristic of serine protease activation with the
               conformation of the catalytic triad being conserved.With the
               determination of isomorphous structures of hirugen–thrombin and
               d‐Phe‐Pro‐Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK)–thrombin, the changes

               chromogenic substrate hydrolysis on binding to the fibrinogen
               recognition exosite have been determined. The backbone of the Ala
               190–Gly 197 segment in the active site has an average RMS
               difference of 0.55 Å between the 2 structures (about 3.7σ
               compared to the bulk structure). This segment has 2 type II
               β‐bends, the first bend showing the largest shift due to hirugen
               binding. Another important feature was the 2 different
               conformations of the side chain of Glu 192. The side chain
               extends to solvent in hirugen–thrombin, which is compatible with
               the binding of substrates having an acidic residue in the P3
               position (protein‐C, thrombin platelet receptor). In
               PPACK–thrombin, the side chain of Asp 189 and the segment Arg
               221A–Gly 223 move to provide space for the inhibitor, whereas in
               hirugenthrombin, the Ala 190–Gly 197 movement expands the active
               site region. Although 8 water molecules are expelled from the

               Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of a nonpeptidyl
               small molecule, previously discovered by medicinal chemistry
               [Tilley, J. W., et al. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 7589-7590],
               which binds to the cytokine IL-2. The small molecule binds to the
               same site that binds the IL-2 alpha receptor and buries into a
               groove not seen in the free structure of IL-2. Comparison of the
               bound and several free structures shows this site to be composed
               of two subsites: one is rigid, and the other is highly adaptive.
               Thermodynamic data suggest the energy barriers between these
               conformations are low. The subsites were dissected by using a
               site-directed screening method called tethering, in which small
               fragments were captured by disulfide interchange with cysteines
               introduced into IL-2 around these subsites. X-ray structures with
               the tethered fragments show that the subsite-binding interactions
               are similar to those observed with the original small molecule.
               Moreover, the adaptive subsite tethered many more compounds than
               did the rigid one. Thus, the adaptive nature of a protein-protein
               interface provides sites for small molecules to bind and
               underscores the challenge of applying structure-based design
               strategies that cannot accurately predict a dynamic protein

               compound (IC50 = 6 muM) bound to a hot spot on IL-2 in a groove
               that is not apparent in either the unliganded protein or a
               complex between IL-2 and a weakly bound drug fragment. The
               affinity-optimized compound (IC50 = 0.06 muM), which has an added
               aromatic acid fragment, bound in the same groove as the lead

               aromatic acid which is unseen in the complex with the lead
               compound. Thus, the hot spot on IL-2 is highly dynamic, with the
               protein changing form at multiple sites to maximize packing for
               each compound. Binding-site rigidity is often thought to play a

               cholesterol-3-O-sulfate, an analog that binds with greater
               apparent affinity than cholesterol. Structures of both apo-bound
               and sterol-bound NPC2 were observed within the same crystal
               lattice, with an asymmetric unit containing one molecule of
               apoNPC2 and two molecules of sterol-bound NPC2. As predicted from
               a previously determined structure of apoNPC2, the sterol binds in
               a deep hydrophobic pocket sandwiched between the two beta-sheets
               of NPC2, with only the sulfate substituent of the ligand exposed
               to solvent. In the two available structures of apoNPC2, the
               incipient ligand-binding pocket, which ranges from a loosely
               packed hydrophobic core to a small tunnel, is too small to
               accommodate cholesterol. In the presence of sterol, the pocket
               expands, facilitated by a slight separation of the beta-strands
               and substantial reorientation of some side chains, resulting in a
               perfect molding of the pocket around the hydrocarbon portion of
               cholesterol. A notable feature is the repositioning of two
               aromatic residues at the tunnel entrance that are essential for
               NPC2 function. The NPC2 structures provide evidence of a
               malleable binding site, consistent with the previously documented

               VAs modulate immune functions, possibly via direct interaction
               with alternative targets on leukocytes. One such target, the
               integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), has

               structure of the LFA-1 ligand-binding domain (I domain) in

               modulation of protein function by isoflurane, as demonstrated for
