              To gain insights into the molecular details of nucleation, some

              simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework
              for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and
              allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence
              densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a
              short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of
              electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against
              experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple
              unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models
              are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity
              domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase
              protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine
              thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein
              concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable
              of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to
              phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of
              the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of
              chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain
              results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most
              importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it
              can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with
              other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional
              features for biological systems of interest.",

                   functions. To gain physical insights into their genetic
                   basis, we study how liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of
                   intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) depends on their
                   sequence charge patterns using a continuum Langevin chain
                   model wherein each amino acid residue is represented by a
                   single bead. Charge patterns are characterized by the
                   `blockiness' measure $\kappa$ and the `sequence charge
                   decoration' (SCD) parameter. Consistent with random phase
                   approximation (RPA) theory and lattice simulations, LLPS
                   propensity as characterized by critical temperature $T^*_{\rm

                   sequences showing a positive correlation between $\kappa$ and
                   $-$SCD. Relative to RPA, the simulated sequence-dependent
                   variation in $T^*_{\rm cr}$ is often---though not
                   always---smaller, whereas the simulated critical volume
                   fractions are higher. However, for a set of sequences

                   the simulated $T^*_{\rm cr}$'s are quite insensitive to

                   sequences that allow for strong electrostatic repulsion can
                   lead to coexistence curves with upward concavity as
                   stipulated by RPA, but the LLPS propensity of a strictly
                   alternating charge sequence was likely overestimated by RPA
                   and lattice models because interchain stabilization of this
                   sequence requires spatial alignments that are difficult to
                   achieve in real space. These results help delineate the

              independently to one another, computational sampling for the
              important process is difficult. Here, to sample such a process
              effectively, we developed a new method, named the
              ``multi-dimensional Virtual-system coupled Monte Carlo
              (multi-dimensional-VcMC)'' method, where the system interacts with
              a virtual system expressed by two or more virtual coordinates.
              Each virtual coordinate controls sampling along a reaction
              coordinate. By setting multiple reaction coordinates to be related
              to the corresponding rare events, sampling of the important
              process can be enhanced. An advantage of multi-dimensional-VcMC is
              its simplicity: Namely, the conformation moves widely in the
              multi-dimensional reaction coordinate space without knowledge of
              canonical distribution functions of the system. To examine the
              effectiveness of the algorithm, we introduced a toy model where
              two molecules (receptor and its ligand) bind and unbind to each
              other. The receptor has a deep binding pocket, to which the ligand
              enters for binding. Furthermore, a gate is set at the entrance of
              the pocket, and the gate is usually closed. Thus, the molecular
              binding takes place via the two events: ligand approach to the
              pocket and gate opening. In two-dimensional (2D)-VcMC, the two
              molecules exhibited repeated binding and unbinding, and an
              equilibrated distribution was obtained as expected. A conventional
              canonical simulation, which was 200 times longer than 2D-VcMC,
              failed in sampling the binding/unbinding effectively. The current

               large-scale motions of a biomolecular system because it maps
               possible pathways for the motions. When the landscape consists of
               thermodynamically stable states (low-energy basins), which are
               connected by narrow conformational pathways (i.e., bottlenecks),
               the narrowness slows the inter-basin round trips in
               conformational sampling. This results in inaccuracy of free
               energies for the basins. This difficulty is not cleared out even
               when an enhanced conformational sampling is fairly performed
               along a reaction coordinate. In this study, to enhance the
               inter-basin round trips we introduced a virtual state that covers
               the narrow pathways. The probability distribution function for
               the virtual state was controlled based on detailed balance
               condition for the inter-state transitions (transitions between
               the real-state basins and the virtual state). To mimic the
               free-energy landscape of a real biological system, we introduced
               a simple model where a wall separates two basins and a narrow
               hole is pierced in the wall to connect the basins. The sampling
               was done based on Monte Carlo (MC). We examined several
               hole-sizes and inter-state transition probabilities. For a small
               hole-size, a small inter-state transition probability produced a
               sampling efficiency 100 times higher than a conventional MC does.
               This result goes against ones intuition, because one considers

               enhance the sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD
               (RAMD) is a simple method to enhance ligand egress from a

               ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction

               Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida has provided a
               paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome P450s.
               However, the mechanism by which camphor, the natural substrate of
               cytochrome P450cam, accesses the buried active site is a
               long-standing puzzle. While there is recent crystallographic and
               simulation evidence for opening of a substrate-access channel in
               cytochrome P450BM-3, for cytochrome P450cam, no such
               conformational changes have been observed either in different
               crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations.
               Here, a novel simulation method, random expulsion molecular
               dynamics, is presented, in which substrate-exit channels from the
               buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly
               oriented force on the substrate, in addition to the standard
               molecular dynamics force field. The random expulsion molecular
               dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate-bound
               structure of cytochrome P450BM-3, and then applied to complexes
               of cytochrome P450cam with different substrates and with product.
               Three pathways were identified, one of which corresponds to a
               channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and
               site-directed mutagenesis data. Exit via the water-filled
               channel, which was previously suggested to be a product exit
               channel, was not observed. The pathways obtained by the random
               expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal
               motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic
               B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions (up to 4 A)
               observed in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid,
               passage of camphor through cytochrome P450cam only requires small
               backbone motions (less than 2.4 A) in conjunction with side-chain
               rotations. Concomitantly, in almost all the exit trajectories,
               salt-links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers
               between secondary structure elements of the protein, are

               and are therefore increasingly being considered during lead
               optimization. For this purpose, computational methods to predict
               residence times, τ, for drug-like compounds and to derive
               structure-kinetic relationships are desirable. A challenge for
               approaches based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the
               fact that drug residence times are typically orders of magnitude
               longer than computationally feasible simulation times. Therefore,
               enhanced sampling methods are required. We recently reported one
               such approach: the τRAMD procedure for estimating relative
               residence times by performing a large number of random
               acceleration MD (RAMD) simulations in which ligand dissociation
               occurs in times of about a nanosecond due to the application of
               an additional randomly oriented force to the ligand. The length
               of the RAMD simulations is used to deduce τ. The RAMD simulations
               also provide information on ligand egress pathways and
               dissociation mechanisms. Here, we describe a machine learning
               approach to systematically analyze protein-ligand binding
               contacts in the RAMD trajectories in order to derive regression
               models for estimating τ and to decipher the molecular features
               leading to longer τ values. We demonstrate that the regression
               models built on the protein-ligand interaction fingerprints of
               the dissociation trajectories result in robust estimates of τ for
               a set of 94 drug-like inhibitors of heat shock protein 90
               (HSP90), even for the compounds for which the length of the RAMD
               trajectories does not provide a good estimation of τ. Thus, we
               find that machine learning helps to overcome inaccuracies in the
               modeling of protein-ligand complexes due to incomplete sampling
               or force field deficiencies. Moreover, the approach facilitates
               the identification of features important for residence time. In
               particular, we observed that interactions of the ligand with the
               sidechain of F138, which is located on the border between the ATP
               binding pocket and a hydrophobic transient sub-pocket, play a key
               role in slowing compound dissociation. We expect that the
               combination of the τRAMD simulation procedure with machine
               learning analysis will be generally applicable as an aid to
               target-based lead optimization.",

               challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this
               information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular
               dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice
               because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable
               simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an
               appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified
               protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows
               for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways
               from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time.
               This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in
               explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction
               coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into
               small conformational states and constructing a Markov model
               between them. A theory is presented that allows for the
               extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the
               unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to
               the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the
               folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of
               individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with
               kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the
               nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly
               complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of
               misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding
               intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.",

               appear to fold via simple two- or three-state mechanisms
               involving mainly native-state interactions, yet recent network
               models built from atomistic simulations of small proteins suggest
               the existence of many possible metastable states and folding
               pathways. We reconcile these two pictures in a combined
               experimental and simulation study of acyl-coenzyme A binding
               protein (ACBP), a two-state folder (folding time ~10 ms)
               exhibiting residual unfolded-state structure, and a putative
               early folding intermediate. Using single-molecule FRET in
               conjunction with side-chain mutagenesis, we first demonstrate
               that the denatured state of ACBP at near-zero denaturant is
               unusually compact and enriched in long-range structure that can
               be perturbed by discrete hydrophobic core mutations. We then
               employ ultrafast laminar-flow mixing experiments to study the
               folding kinetics of ACBP on the microsecond time scale. These
               studies, along with Trp-Cys quenching measurements of
               unfolded-state dynamics, suggest that unfolded-state structure
               forms on a surprisingly slow (~100 μs) time scale, and that
               sequence mutations strikingly perturb both time-resolved and
               equilibrium smFRET measurements in a similar way. A Markov state
               model (MSM) of the ACBP folding reaction, constructed from over
               30 ms of molecular dynamics trajectory data, predicts a complex
               network of metastable stables, residual unfolded-state structure,
               and kinetics consistent with experiment but no well-defined
               intermediate preceding the main folding barrier. Taken together,
               these experimental and simulation results suggest that the
               previously characterized fast kinetic phase is not due to
               formation of a barrier-limited intermediate but rather to a more
               heterogeneous and slow acquisition of unfolded-state structure.",

               macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and
               continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the
               performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study
               of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we
               explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD)
               simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute
               dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies
               predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions
               could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact
               on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always
               necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are
               quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this
               parameter should be carefully determined according to the
               characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3)
               Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD
               trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to
               achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of
               the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born
               (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and
               Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding
               affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the
               performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free
               energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in

               molecular mechanism of binding between two molecules. We
               developed the McMD-based dynamic docking methodology based on the
               powerful, but woefully underutilized McMD algorithm, combined
               with a toolset to perform the docking and to analyze the results.
               Here, we showcase three of our recent works, where we have

              drug-receptor interactions. A derivative of MD, namely, steered
              molecular dynamics (SMD), has been demonstrated as a promising
              tool for rational drug design. In this paper, we review various
              studies over the last 20 years using SMD simulations, thus paving
              the way to determine the relationship between protein structure
              and function. In addition, the paper highlights the use of SMD
              simulation for in silico drug design. We also aim to establish an
              understanding on the key interactions which play a crucial role in
              the stabilization of peptide-ligand interfaces, the binding and
              unbinding mechanism of the ligand-protein complex, the mechanism
              of ligand translocating via membrane, and the ranking of different

               two known protein conformations is presented. It is based on a
               molecular dynamics simulation starting from one conformational
               state as initial structure and using the other for a directing
               constraint. The method is exemplified with the T ↔ R transition
               of insulin. The most striking difference between these
               conformational states is that in T the 8 N-terminal residues of
               the B chain are arranged as an extended strand whereas in R they
               are forming a helix. Both the transition from T to R and from R
               to T were simulated. The method proves capable of finding a
               continuous pathway for each direction which are moderately
               different. The refolding processes are illustrated by a series of
               transient structures and pairs of Ø, ψ angles selected from the
               time course of the simulations. In the T → R direction the helix
               is formed in the →last third of the transition, while in the R →
               T direction it is preserved during more than half of the

               potential contribution are differences in the glycosylation of
               target human cells, particularly as SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity
               to bind sialic acid which is a common, and highly variable,
               terminal modification of glycans. The viral spike glycoprotein
               (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and the human cellular receptor,
               angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are both densely
               glycosylated. We therefore sought to investigate whether the
               glycosylation state of ACE2 impacts the interaction with
               SARS-CoV-2 viral spike. We generated a panel of engineered ACE2
               glycoforms which were analyzed by mass spectrometry to reveal the
               site-specific glycan modifications. We then probed the impact of
               ACE2 glycosylation on S binding and revealed a subtle sensitivity
               with hypersialylated or oligomannose-type glycans slightly
               impeding the interaction. In contrast, deglycosylation of ACE2
               did not influence SARS-CoV-2 binding. Overall, ACE2 glycosylation
               does not significantly influence viral spike binding. We suggest
               that any role of glycosylation in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2
               will lie beyond its immediate impact of receptor glycosylation on
               virus binding.",

              action. We used bespoke computational grid calculations to predict
              the positions of energy minima in the interactions of noble gases
              with diverse proteins. The method was validated by quantifying how
              well simulations could predict binding positions in 131 diverse
              protein X-ray structures containing 399 Xe and Kr atoms. We found
              excellent agreement between calculated and experimental binding
              positions of noble gases. 94 \% of all crystallographic xenon
              atoms were within 1 Xe van der Waals (vdW) diameter of a predicted
              binding site, and 97 \% lay within 2 vdW diameters. 100 \% of
              crystallographic krypton atoms were within 1 Kr vdW diameter of a
              predicted binding site. We showed the feasibility of large-scale
              computational screening of all ≈60 000 unique structures in the
              Protein Data Bank. This will elucidate biochemical mechanisms by
              which these novel 'atomic drugs' elicit their valuable biochemical
              properties and identify new medical uses.",

                   distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly
                   injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that
                   transforms the prior distribution back into the data

               Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the
               extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which
               mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting

               SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host
               immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the
               glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed

               binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift

               to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

               SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction
               with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity than its
               binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1,

               application, the guiding factor is designed to satisfy the

               simulations in explicit solvent can provide an accurate model for
               biomolecules in solution, explicit solvent simulations are
               hampered by the slow equilibration on rugged landscapes
               containing multiple basins separated by barriers. In many cases,
               implicit solvent models can be used to significantly speed up the
               conformational sampling; however, implicit solvent simulations do
               not fully capture the effects of a molecular solvent, and this
               can lead to loss of accuracy in the estimated free energies. Here
               we introduce a new approach to compute free energy changes in

               connects the free energy basins in implicit solvent and explicit

               by computing conformational free energy differences and solvation

               investigating proteins each of which possesses a cryptic site.
               From their X-ray structures, we saw that aromatic residues tended

               its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine
               design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds
               the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter
               the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated,

               determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic
               strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom
               simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii)
               RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii)
               RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations
               identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form

               we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by
               the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2
               interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we

               and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology
               has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the
               field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with
               the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning
               practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should
               balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express
               underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting
               spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models
               such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e.,
               interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be
               considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on
               test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about
               the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their
               relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the
               classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified
               performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the
               textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how
               increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation
               results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the
               existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of
               models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence.
               This connection between the performance and the structure of
               machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical
               analyses and has implications for both the theory and the
               practice of machine learning.",

               sites require a conformational change to become apparent; a
               cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that forms a
               pocket in a holo structure, but not in the apo structure. Because
               many proteins appear to lack druggable pockets, understanding and
               accurately identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug
               targets. Previously, cryptic sites were identified experimentally
               by fragment-based ligand discovery and computationally by long
               molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. Here, we
               begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo-holo
               pairs with cryptic sites. Next, we comprehensively characterize
               the cryptic sites in terms of their sequence, structure, and
               dynamics attributes. We find that cryptic sites tend to be as
               conserved in evolution as traditional binding pockets but are
               less hydrophobic and more flexible. Relying on this
               characterization, we use machine learning to predict cryptic
               sites with relatively high accuracy (for our benchmark, the true
               positive and false positive rates are 73\% and 29\%,
               respectively). We then predict cryptic sites in the entire
               structurally characterized human proteome (11,201 structures,
               covering 23\% of all residues in the proteome). CryptoSite
               increases the size of the potentially ``druggable'' human
               proteome from ~40\% to ~78\% of disease-associated proteins.
               Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach in practice,
               we experimentally validate a cryptic site in protein tyrosine
               phosphatase 1B using a covalent ligand and NMR spectroscopy. The

               different quantities. The most popular one is the binding free
               energy, which can be estimated by several methods in conventional
               molecular dynamics simulation. So far in steered molecular
               dynamics (SMD), one can use either the rupture force or
               nonequilibrium pulling work as a measure for binding affinity. In
               this paper, we have shown that the nonequilibrium binding free
               energy Δ GneqJar, obtained by Jarzynski's equality at a finite
               pulling speed, has good correlation with experimental data on
               inhibition constants, implying that this quantity can be used as
               a good scoring function for binding affinity. A similar
               correlation has also been disclosed for binding and unbinding
               free energy barriers. Applying the SMD method to unbinding of 23
               small compounds from the binding site of β-lactamase protein, a
               bacteria-produced enzyme, we have demonstrated that the rupture

               equality, the rupture time depends on the unbinding barrier
               exponentially. We show that Δ GneqJar, the rupture time, and
               binding and unbinding free energy barriers are good descriptors
               for binding affinity. Our observation may be useful for fast
               screening of potential leads as the SMD simulation is not
               time-consuming. On the basis of nonequilibrium simulation, we
               disclosed that, in agreement with the experiment, the binding

               that hydrophobic interactions are also playing a role in its
               stabilization. At 30 degrees C, the calorimetric enthalpy and
               entropy values are estimated to be 650(+/-50) cal mol(-1)and
               2.0(+/-0.2) cal K(-1)mole(-1), respectively, per residue of this
               peptide. Comparison with the thermodynamic characteristics
               obtained for the unfolding of double-stranded alpha-helical
               coiled-coils shows that at that temperature the enthalpic
               contribution of non-polar groups to the stabilization of the
               alpha-helix is insignificant and the estimated transition
               enthalpy can be assigned to the hydrogen bonds. With increasing
               temperature, the increasing magnitude of the negative enthalpy of
               hydration of the exposed polar groups should decrease the
               helix-stabilizing enthalpy of the backbone hydrogen bonds.
               However, the helix-stabilizing negative entropy of hydration of
               these groups should also increase in magnitude with increasing
               temperature, offsetting this effect.",

               domains, exhibits nanosecond unfolding only after a force above
               1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of
               protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces
               for nanosecond unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are
               needed to concertedly break a set of interstrand hydrogen bonds
               which protect the domains against unfolding through stretching;
               in the second case, stretching breaks backbone hydrogen bonds one
               by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose.

               interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These
               bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for
               sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force
               probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of
               adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent
               properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of
               bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction
               kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested
               the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics)
               simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the
               force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests
               of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture
               forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond
               strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading
               rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading
               (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent
               enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the
               slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength
               grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial
               coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates,
               there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues
               to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many
               decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at
               ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular
               dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly
               overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked
               frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation.
               Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength,
               molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span
               of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the
               time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the
               extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a

               the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like
               structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54
               carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion
               (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration,
               individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed

               two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the
               inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce

               flexible binding manner when recognizing a partner molecule.
               Moreover, it is recognized that binding of IDRs to a partner
               molecule is accompanied by folding, with a variety of bound
               conformations often being allowed in formation of the complex. In
               this study, we investigated a fragment of the disordered p53
               C-terminal domain (CTDf) that interacts with one of its partner
               molecules, S100B, as a representative IDR. Although the 3D
               structure of CTDf in complex with S100B has been previously
               reported, the specific interactions remained controversial. To
               clarify these interactions, we performed generalized ensemble
               molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (virtual-system coupled
               multicanonical MD, termed V-McMD), which enable effective
               conformational sampling beyond that provided by conventional MD.
               These simulations generated a multimodal structural distribution
               for our system including CTDf and S100B, indicating that CTDf
               forms a variety of complex structures upon binding to S100B. We

               modeling, in which the streptavidin and rhizavidin sequences were
               combined to engineer a high affinity binding pocket containing
               residues from a single subunit only. Although mSA is stable and
               binds biotin with nanomolar affinity, its fast off rate (koff)
               creates practical challenges during applications. We obtained a
               1.9 Å crystal structure of mSA bound to biotin to understand
               their interaction in detail, and used the structure to introduce
               targeted mutations to improve its binding kinetics. To this end,
               we compared mSA to shwanavidin, which contains a hydrophobic lid
               containing F43 in the binding pocket and binds biotin tightly.
               However, the T48F mutation in mSA, which introduces a comparable
               hydrophobic lid, only resulted in a modest 20–40\% improvement in
               the measured koff. On the other hand, introducing the S25H
               mutation near the bicyclic ring of bound biotin increased the
               dissociation half life (t½) from 11 to 83 min at 20°C. Molecular
               dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that H25 stabilizes the binding
               loop L3,4 by interacting with A47, and protects key
               intermolecular hydrogen bonds by limiting solvent entry into the
               binding pocket. Concurrent T48F or T48W mutation clashes with H25
               and partially abrogates the beneficial effects of H25. Taken

               determinants of the dissociation kinetics in mSA. Proteins 2013.

  abstract = "Influenza virus can escape most antibodies with single mutations.
              However, rare antibodies broadly neutralize many viral strains. It
              is unclear how easily influenza virus might escape such antibodies
              if there was strong pressure to do so. Here, we map all single
              amino-acid mutations that increase resistance to broad antibodies
              to H1 hemagglutinin. Our approach not only identifies antigenic
              mutations but also quantifies their effect sizes. All antibodies
              select mutations, but the effect sizes vary widely. The virus can
              escape a broad antibody to hemagglutinin's receptor-binding site
              the same way it escapes narrow strain-specific antibodies: via
              single mutations with huge effects. In contrast, broad antibodies
              to hemagglutinin's stalk only select mutations with small effects.
              Therefore, among the antibodies we examine, breadth is an
              imperfect indicator of the potential for viral escape via single
              mutations. Antibodies targeting the H1 hemagglutinin stalk are
              quantifiably harder to escape than the other antibodies tested
              here.",

               of researchers. The main idea of using SMD to screen out leads is
               based on the hypothesis that the larger is the force needed to
               unbind a ligand from a receptor the higher its binding affinity.
               Thus, instead of binding free energy, the rupture force defined
               as the maximum on the force-time/displacement profile, is used as
               a score function. In this mini-review, we discuss basic concepts
               behind the experimental technique atomic force microscopy as well
               as SMD. Experimental and theoretical works on the application of
               SMD to the drug design problem are covered. Accumulated evidences

               more efficient. The high correlation level between theoretically

               energies implies that SMD is a promising tool for drug design.

               was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a
               balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction
               (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the
               solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions.
               Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental
               gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy
               surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide
               backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data
               for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction
               parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by
               fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of
               complexes between water and model compounds that represented the
               backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole
               moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization,
               solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal
               pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The
               resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to
               noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the
               proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and

               relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current
               efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from
               studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the
               quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate
               treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve
               representative conformational distributions in simulation
               studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone,
               quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM)
               calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline
               dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined
               with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal
               and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine
               and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels,
               where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to
               available QM studies on these molecules. The
               LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides
               were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides.
               These improvements included additional parameter optimization via
               Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential
               energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral
               crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term.
               Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their
               crystalline environments were used to validate the force field
               enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed
               that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral
               parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were
               required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22
               force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of
               phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident.
               Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based
               energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these
               systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater
               deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded
               improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These
               improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in
               treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy
               function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of
               biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.",

               distinctly nonlinear trends in rupture force with loading rate
               that are typically explained in conventional models by invoking
               complex escape pathways. Recent analyses suggested that these

               basic assumptions of bond rupture dynamics and thus may represent
               the norm rather than the exception. Here we explore how these
               nonlinear trends reflect the two fundamental regimes of bond
               rupture: (i) a near-equilibrium regime, produced either by bond
               reforming in the case of a single bond or by asynchronized
               rupture of multiple individual bonds, and (ii) a kinetic regime
               produced by fast, non-equilibrium bond rupture. We analyze both

               far-from-equilibrium loading regimes, and show that both

               from 10 different molecular systems show that this model provides
               a comprehensive description of force spectra for a diverse suite
               of bonds over experimentally relevant loading rates, removes the
               inconsistencies of previous interpretations of transition state
               distances, and gives ready access to both kinetic and
               thermodynamic information about the interaction. These results

               transformation of the rupture-force histograms obtained at
               different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes
               measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the
               force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's
               formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers
               theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the
               lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model
               potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore
               unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached

               poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy
               surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic
               interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because

               generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of
               organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is
               to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G*
               electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying
               electronic structure features, including formal charge and
               electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population
               charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then
               applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC
               charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting
               to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most
               organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as
               well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic
               heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the
               AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic
               compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database.
               Validation of the model was done through comparisons of
               hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of
               solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994
               Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer
               hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were
               reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab
               initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9
               kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated
               relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of
               monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol
               of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the
               AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above
               0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the
               AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative
               to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force

  abstract      = "A well-known limitation of existing molecular generative
                   models is that the generated molecules highly resemble those
                   in the training set. To generate truly novel molecules that
                   may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery,
                   more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary.
                   To this end, we propose Molecular Out-Of-distribution
                   Diffusion(MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that
                   incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the
                   generative stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simple
                   control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional
                   costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic
                   requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional
                   generation by utilizing the gradients from a property
                   predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to
                   high-scoring regions according to target properties such as
                   protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and
                   synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and
                   meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet
                   trivial ones. We experimentally validate that MOOD is able to
                   explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution,
                   generating molecules that outscore ones found with existing

               of infinite nonequilibrium transitions is estimated as a finite
               sample average, resulting in the so-called Jarzynski estimator, Δ

               approximation of the Jarzynski equality, though seldom invoked,
               is exact for Gaussian distributions and gives rise to the

               Ruminococcus flavefaciens called X-module-Dockerin (XDoc) bound

               scientific and public attention. Here, we studied the binding
               properties between the human receptor ACE2 (hACE2) and the VOC
               RBDs and resolved the crystal and cryoelectron microscopy
               structures of the omicron RBD-hACE2 complex as well as the
               crystal structure of the delta RBD-hACE2 complex. We found that,
               unlike alpha, beta, and gamma, omicron RBD binds to hACE2 at a
               similar affinity to that of the prototype RBD, which might be due
               to compensation of multiple mutations for both immune escape and
               transmissibility. The complex structures of omicron RBD-hACE2 and
               delta RBD-hACE2 reveal the structural basis of how RBD-specific

               to identify collective variables {xi} = x, which can be used to
               construct the free energy landscape ΔG(x) of a molecular system.
               While PCA is routinely applied to equilibrium molecular dynamics
               (MD) simulations, it is less obvious as to how to extend the
               approach to nonequilibrium simulation techniques. This includes,
               e.g., the definition of the statistical averages employed in PCA
               as well as the relation between the equilibrium free energy
               landscape ΔG(x) and the energy landscapes ΔG(x) obtained from
               nonequilibrium MD. As an example for a nonequilibrium method,
               ``targeted MD'' is considered which employs a moving distance
               constraint to enforce rare transitions along some biasing
               coordinate s. The introduced bias can be described by a weighting
               function P(s), which provides a direct relation between
               equilibrium and nonequilibrium data, and thus establishes a
               well-defined way to perform PCA on nonequilibrium data. While the
               resulting distribution P(x) and energy ΔG∝lnP will not reflect
               the equilibrium state of the system, the nonequilibrium energy
               landscape ΔG(x) may directly reveal the molecular reaction
               mechanism. Applied to targeted MD simulations of the unfolding of
               decaalanine, for example, a PCA performed on backbone dihedral
               angles is shown to discriminate several unfolding pathways.
               Although the formulation is in principle exact, its practical use
               depends critically on the choice of the biasing coordinate s,
               which should account for a naturally occurring motion between two
               well-defined end-states of the system.",

               simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in
               space in such a way to approximately represent the system's
               overall structure. In order that the simulations are not
               disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms
               from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances.
               Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a
               packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial
               constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the
               distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater
               than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to
               pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules,
               inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be
               intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes.
               The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each
               type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule
               must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating
               biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents,
               is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the

               regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements
               can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing
               time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from
               a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input

               challenging in computational chemistry and biophysics. To address
               this challenge, we have developed a new computational method,
               ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), which
               selectively boosts the ligand nonbonded interaction potential
               energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics
               (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could
               be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system
               in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand
               binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and
               protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding
               and unbinding in the β-cyclodextrin host were observed in
               hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated
               guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental
               data with <1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged
               microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics
               simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD\_Dual simulations were
               also <1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate
               constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using
               Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture
               repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor
               in trypsin within 1 μs simulations. The calculated ligand binding
               free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the

               enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding

               steered molecular dynamics (SMD) in which the driving of the

               SMD, many nonequilibrium trajectories are generated allowing for
               fast sampling of the ensemble space and access to rare events.
               Equilibrium observables, such as the potential of mean force
               along the pathway, result from averaging over these trajectories
               using Jarzynski's Equality (JE). Unfortunately, in SMD, a large
               number of trajectories are needed to cover all possible
               configurations in order to obtain converged quantities in the
               exponential average of the JE, and this is computationally
               expensive. ASMD reduces the number of trajectories that must be
               sampled by discarding those trajectories that have deviated far
               from the equilibrium path in stages. At the end of a stage, one
               chooses ? or contracts ? one (in naïve ASMD) or some (in
               multi-branched ASMD or MB-ASMD) of the configurations produced
               from the previous stage to initiate the trajectories in the next

               generated structures are relaxed under the constraint of a fixed

               a direct comparison of the energetics and other observables

               the system is sufficiently small that computational resources are
               not a limiting concern. It gives the highest accuracy in such
               cases while avoiding the inefficiencies of SMD. However, for
               complex energy landscapes typical of most multi-domain proteins,
               MB-ASMD is preferred because it provides a mechanism to sample
               alternative pathways while suffering only a modest loss in

               research on critical questions in biology and drug discovery.
               This speedup means that a 512-node Anton 3 simulates a million
               atoms at over 100 microseconds per day. Furthermore, Anton 3
               attains this performance while consuming an order of magnitude

               Like its predecessors, Anton 3 was designed from the ground up

               an inhibitor is in complex with its target, is a fundamental part
               of the drug discovery process. Synthesis and experimental
               measurements of kinetic rate constants are, however, expensive
               and time consuming. In this work, we aimed to obtain drug
               residence times computationally. Furthermore, we propose a novel
               algorithm to identify molecular design objectives based on ligand
               unbinding kinetics. We designed an enhanced sampling technique to
               accurately predict the free-energy profiles of the ligand
               unbinding process, focusing on the free-energy barrier for
               unbinding. Our method first identifies unbinding paths
               determining a corresponding set of internal coordinates (ICs)
               that form contacts between the protein and the ligand; it then
               iteratively updates these interactions during a series of biased
               molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the ICs that are
               important for the whole of the unbinding process. Subsequently,
               we performed finite-temperature string simulations to obtain the
               free-energy barrier for unbinding using the set of ICs as a
               complex reaction coordinate. Importantly, we also aimed to enable
               the further design of drugs focusing on improved residence times.
               To this end, we developed a supervised machine learning (ML)
               approach with inputs from unbiased ``downhill'' trajectories
               initiated near the transition state (TS) ensemble of the string
               unbinding path. We demonstrate that our ML method can identify
               key ligand-protein interactions driving the system through the
               TS. Some of the most important drugs for cancer treatment are
               kinase inhibitors. One of these kinase targets is
               cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), an appealing target for
               anticancer drug development. Here, we tested our method using two
               different CDK2 inhibitors for the potential further development
               of these compounds. We compared the free-energy barriers obtained
               from our calculations with those observed in available
               experimental data. We highlighted important interactions at the
               distal ends of the ligands that can be targeted for improved
               residence times. Our method provides a new tool to determine
               unbinding rates and to identify key structural features of the
               inhibitors that can be used as starting points for novel design
               strategies in drug discovery.",

              then following this with a procedure to estimate the free energy
              associated with the motion of the flap region. To illustrate our
              overall workflow, we explored the free energy changes in the
              streptavidin/biotin system upon introducing conformational
              flexibility in loop3-4 in the biotin unbound ( apo) and bound (
              holo) state. The free energy surfaces were created using the
              Movable Type free energy method, and for further validation, we
              compared them to potential of mean force (PMF) generated free
              energy surfaces using MD simulations employing the FF99SBILDN and

               generating transition paths in complex biomolecular systems is
               revisited. In a typical TMD transition path, the large-scale
               changes occur early and the small-scale changes tend to occur
               later. As a result, the order of events in the computed paths
               depends on the direction in which the simulations are performed.
               To identify the origin of this bias, and to propose a method in
               which the bias is absent, variants of TMD in the restraint
               formulation are introduced and applied to the complex open ↔
               closed transition in the protein calmodulin. Due to the global
               best-fit rotation that is typically part of the TMD method, the
               simulated system is guided implicitly along the lowest-frequency
               normal modes, until the large spatial scales associated with
               these modes are near the target conformation. The remaining
               portion of the transition is described progressively by
               higher-frequency modes, which correspond to smaller-scale
               rearrangements. A straightforward modification of TMD that avoids
               the global best-fit rotation is the locally restrained TMD
               (LRTMD) method, in which the biasing potential is constructed
               from a number of TMD potentials, each acting on a small connected
               portion of the protein sequence. With a uniform distribution of
               these elements, transition paths that lack the length-scale bias
               are obtained. Trajectories generated by steered MD in dihedral
               angle space (DSMD), a method that avoids best-fit rotations
               altogether, also lack the length-scale bias. To examine the
               importance of the paths generated by TMD, LRTMD, and DSMD in the
               actual transition, we use the finite-temperature string method to
               compute the free energy profile associated with a transition tube
               around a path generated by each algorithm. The free energy
               barriers associated with the paths are comparable, suggesting
               that transitions can occur along each route with similar
               probabilities. This result indicates that a broad ensemble of
               paths needs to be calculated to obtain a full description of
               conformational changes in biomolecules. The breadth of the
               contributing ensemble suggests that energetic barriers for
               conformational transitions in proteins are offset by entropic
               contributions that arise from a large number of possible paths.",

               are parallel to the mean force at every nonstationary point of
               the free energy landscape. In contrast to adiabatic paths, which
               are parallel to the force, OFEPs include the effect of entropy
               and are relevant even for systems with diffusive degrees of
               freedom. In this study the OFEPs are computed for the alanine
               dipeptide in solution. The potential of mean force is calculated
               and an effective potential is derived that is used to obtain the
               paths with a minimization based algorithm. The comparison of the
               calculated paths with the adiabatic paths in vacuo shows the
               influence of the environment on conformational transitions. The
               dynamics of the alanine dipeptide in water are more complex,
               since there are more minima and the barriers are lower. Two
               simpler methods for the calculation of reaction pathways in
               solution are evaluated by comparing their results with the OFEPs.
               In the first method the mean electrostatic field of the water is
               approximated by an analytical continuum model. The obtained paths
               show qualitative agreement with the OFEPs and the height of the
               barriers are similar. Targeted molecular dynamics (TMD), the
               second approach, constrains the distance to a target conformation
               to accelerate the transition. In the general case, however, it is
               difficult to assess the physical significance of the obtained
               paths. Changing the initial conditions by assigning different
               velocities leads to different solutions for the conformational
               transition. Furthermore, it is shown that by performing the
               simulations with different reaction coordinates or in opposite
               directions different pathways are preferred. This result can be
               explained by the structure of the free energy landscape around
               the initial conformations. In a first approximation the physical
               significance of different pathways is assumed to depend mainly on
               the free energy at the highest saddle point. In the literature
               the total energy of the system has often been used to estimate
               the position and the height of the energy barriers in the path.
               By comparing the total energy with the calculated free energy it
               is shown that the former largely overestimates the height of the
               barriers. Furthermore, the positions of the maxima of the total
               energy do not coincide with the free energy barriers. Simple
               approximations to the free energy lead to good quantitative
               agreement.",

               glucose metabolism. An unusual mechanism of positive
               cooperativity of monomeric GK containing only a single binding
               site for glucose is very interesting and still unclear. The
               activation process of GK is associated with a large-scale
               conformational change from the inactive to the active state.
               Here, conventional and targeted molecular dynamics simulations
               were used to study the conformational dynamics of GK in the
               stable configurations and in the transition from active to
               inactive state. Three phases of the structural reorganization of
               GK were detected. The first step is a transformation of GK from
               the active state to the intermediate structure, where the cleft
               between the domains is open, but alpha helix 13 is still inside
               the small domain. From this point, there are two alternative
               paths. One path leads to the inactive state through the release
               of helix 13 from the inside of small domain to the outside. Other
               path goes back to the active state. Simulation results reveal the
               critical role of helix 13 in the transformation of GK from the
               open state to inactive one and the influence of the loop 2 on the
               protein transformation between the open and the closed active
               states. Principal component analysis and covariance matrix
               analysis were carried out to analyze the dynamics of protein.
               Importance of hydrogen bonds in the stability of the closed
               conformation is shown. Overall, our simulations provide new
               information about the dynamics of GK and its structural

               conformations in vivo: (1) a monomeric form called the PP-fold in
               which a polyproline tail is folded onto an α-helix via a β-turn
               and (2) a dimeric form of the unfolded proteins in which the
               α-helices interact with each other via side chains. The
               transition pathway and rates between the two conformations remain
               unknown and are important to the nature of the binding of the
               protein. Toward addressing this question, the present work
               suggests that the unfolding of the PP-fold is too slow to play a
               role in NPY monomeric binding unless the receptor catalyzes it to
               do so. Specifically, the dynamics and structural changes of the
               unfolding of a monomeric NPY protein have been investigated in
               this work. Temperature accelerated molecular dynamics (MD)
               simulations at 500 K under constant (N,V,E) conditions suggests a
               hinge-like unraveling of the tail rather than a random unfolding.
               The free energetics of the proposed unfolding pathway have been
               described using an adaptive steered MD (SMD) approach at various
               temperatures. This approach generalizes the use of Jarzynski's

               has been the extraction of information from such simulations that
               generalize for complex nonequilibrium processes. The use of
               Jarzynski's equality opened the possibility of determining the
               free energy along the steered coordinate, but sampling over the
               nonequilibrium trajectories is slow to converge. Adaptive steered
               molecular dynamics (ASMD) and other related techniques have been
               introduced to overcome this challenge through the use of stages.
               Here, we take advantage of these stages to address the numerical
               cost that arises from the required use of very large solvent
               boxes. We introduce telescoping box schemes within adaptive

               box between stages and thereby vary (and optimize) the required
               number of solvent molecules. We have benchmarked the method on a
               relatively long α-helical peptide, Ala30, with respect to the
               potential of mean force and hydrogen bonds. We show that the use

              central and peripheral nervous system. The peptide interacts with
              membrane-bound receptors to control processes such as food intake,
              vasoconstriction, and memory retention. The N-terminal polyproline
              sequence of NPY folds back onto a C-terminal α-helix to form a
              hairpin structure. The hairpin undergoes transient unfolding to
              allow the monomer to interact with its target membranes and
              receptors and to form reversible dimers in solution. Using
              computational, functional, and biophysical approaches, we
              characterized the role of two conserved tyrosines (Y20 and Y27)
              located within the hydrophobic core of the hairpin fold.
              Successive mutation of the tyrosines to more hydrophobic
              phenylalanines increased the thermal stability of NPY and reduced
              functional activity, consistent with computational studies
              predicting a more stable hairpin structure. However, mutant
              stability was high relative to wild-type: melting temperatures
              increased by approximately 20 °C for the single mutants (Y20F and
              Y27F) and by 30 °C for the double mutant (Y20F + Y27F). These
              findings suggested that the mutations were not just simply
              enhancing hairpin structure stability, but might also be driving
              self-association to dimer. Using analytical ultracentrifugation,
              we determined that the mutations indeed increased
              self-association, but shifted the equilibrium toward hexamer-like
              species. Notably, these latter species were not unique to the NPY
              mutants, but were found to preexist at low levels in the wild-type
              population. Collectively, the findings indicate that NPY
              self-association is more complex than previously recognized and
              that the ensemble of NPY quaternary states is tunable by
              modulating hairpin hydrophobicity.",

               has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution

               Here we describe a method, using atomistic ensemble-based steered

               from their target G protein-coupled receptor in a time scale

               accurately, precisely, and reproducibly identify ligand-residue

               capable of reconstructing equilibrium properties such as the
               Potential of Mean Force (PMF). Of course, one would like to use
               all types of force fields (FF) ranging from classical ones to
               more advanced polarizable models using point induced dipoles and
               distributed multipoles such as AMOEBA. To enable such studies,
               the SMD methodology has been implemented in the framework of the
               massively parallel Tinker-HP software allowing for both long
               polarizable and non-polarizable MD simulations of large proteins.
               To validate this new implementation, we first compared the
               Tinker-HP SMD results to the literature. Tests have been
               performed on three different benchmark systems: the M-A
               deca-alanine (112 atoms), the ubiquitin (9737 atoms), and the
               CD2CD58 complex (97594 atoms). Non-polarizable (AMBER99,
               AMBER99SB, CHARMM22/CMAP, and OPLS-AA/L) and polarizable
               (AMOEBAPRO13 and AMOEBABIO18) force fields have been used. For
               each one of them, PMFs have been reconstructed and compared in
               terms of free energy barrier and hydrogen bonding fluctuations
               behavior over time. Using a SMD velocity of 0.01 Å/ps applied to
               a set of 20 trajectories, we show that polarizable and
               non-polarizable force fields do not always agree. As it could be
               anticipated, strong discrepancies are noticed between polarizable
               and non-polarizable models when considered in vacuum, whereas
               results are more comparable when a water environment is added.
               However, for the largest system, i.e., the CD2CD58 complex,
               strong differences related to the modeling of a salt bridge are
               noticed exhibiting some potential issues with classical FFs.
               Overall, such simulations highlight the importance of the
               inclusion of polarization effects as PMF free energy barriers
               computed with AMOEBA always decrease compared to non-polarizable

              issues, including long QT syndromes (LQTS), congenital atrial
              fibrillation, and short QT syndrome. Off-target interactions of

              been known to cause fatal cardiac irregularities. Thus,
              KCNQ1/KCNE1 remains an important avenue for drug-design and
              discovery research. In this work, we present the structural and
              mechanistic details of potassium ion permeation through an open
              KCNQ1 structural model using the combined molecular dynamics and
              steered molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the processes
              and key residues involved in the permeation of a potassium ion
              through the KCNQ1 ion channel, and how the ion permeation is
              affected by (i) the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interactions and (ii) the binding
              of chromanol 293B ligand and its derivatives into the complex. The
              results reveal that interactions between KCNQ1 with KCNE1 causes a
              pore constriction in the former, which in-turn forms small
              energetic barriers in the ion-permeation pathway. These findings
              correlate with the previous experimental reports that interactions
              of KCNE1 dramatically slows the activation of KCNQ1. Upon
              ligand-binding onto the complex, the energy-barriers along ion
              permeation path are more pronounced, as expected, therefore,
              requiring higher force in our steered-MD simulations.
              Nevertheless, pulling the ion when a weak blocker is bound to the
              channel does not necessitate high force in SMD. This indicates
              that our SMD simulations have been able to discern between strong
              and week blockers and reveal their influence on potassium ion
              permeation. The findings presented here will have some
              implications in understanding the potential off-target
              interactions of the drugs with the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel that lead

  abstract  = "Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a robust
               computational method for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced
               sampling and free energy calculations of biomolecules. It works
               by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular
               potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly
               accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude.
               Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or
               collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced
               sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological
               processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian
               distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via
               cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., ``Gaussian
               approximation''). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free
               energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other
               enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica exchange GaMD
               (rex-GaMD) and replica exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS),
               have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free
               energy calculations. Recently, new ``selective GaMD'' algorithms
               including the ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD)
               enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive
               dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly
               flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient
               quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding
               thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its
               innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of
               biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational
               changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding,
               protein-protein/nucleic acid/carbohydrate interactions, and
               carbohydrate/nucleic acid interactions. In this review, we
               present principles of the GaMD algorithms and recent applications

               parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for
               evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force
               acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives
               with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in

               first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect
               to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example,
               the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of
               its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also
               straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can

               potential energy minima with high free energy barriers for large
               numbers of computational steps. The dynamic evolution of many
               molecular systems occurs through a series of rare events as the
               system moves from one potential energy basin to another.
               Therefore, we have proposed a robust bias potential function that

               wells are enhanced, which accelerates and extends the time scale

               potential energy minima to be well defined, and hence properly

               technique to study biomolecular systems, which complements
               experiments by providing insights into the structural dynamics
               relevant to biological functions at atomic scale. It can also be
               used to calculate the free energy landscapes of the
               conformational transitions to better understand the functions of
               the biomolecules. However, the sampling of biomolecular
               configurations is limited by the free energy barriers that need
               to be overcome, leading to considerable gaps between the
               timescales reached by MD simulation and those governing
               biological processes. To address this issue, many enhanced
               sampling methodologies have been developed to increase the
               sampling efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations and free
               energy calculations. Usually, enhanced sampling algorithms can be
               classified into methods based on collective variables (CV-based)
               and approaches which do not require predefined CVs (CV-free). In

               within the same framework, acceleration of rare events and
               estimation of the free energy of complex molecular systems. It is
               based on iteratively ‘filling’ the potential energy of the system
               by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a
               suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby
               forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The
               power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of
               extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope
               of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of
               these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.
               The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous
               alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the
               CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting
               estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted
               transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second
               scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should
               be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient
               or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using
               machine learning approaches. Metadynamics is a technique to
               enhance the probability of observing rare events, such as
               chemical reactions and phase transitions, in molecular dynamics
               simulations. This Technical Review surveys the technique,

               complex systems. Efficiency and accuracy of these enhanced

               appropriate collective variables for enhanced sampling and
               generating accurate free energy surfaces. Recently, many machine
               learning techniques have been developed to improve the quality of
               collective variables and the accuracy of free energy surfaces.
               Although machine learning has achieved great successes in
               improving enhanced sampling methods, there are still many

               binding mechanisms of a middle-sized flexible molecule, bosentan,
               to a GPCR protein, human endothelin receptor type B (hETB).
               GA-mD-VcMD is a generalized ensemble method that produces a
               free-energy landscape of the ligand-receptor binding by searching
               large-scale motions accompanied with stable maintenance of the
               fragile cell-membrane structure. All molecular components
               (bosentan, hETB, membrane, and solvent) were represented with an
               all-atom model. Then sampling was conducted from conformations
               where bosentan was distant from the binding site in the hETB
               binding pocket. The deepest basin in the resultant free-energy
               landscape was assigned to native-like complex conformation. The
               following binding mechanism was inferred. First, bosentan
               fluctuating randomly in solution is captured using a tip region
               of the flexible N-terminal tail of hETB via nonspecific
               attractive interactions (fly casting). Bosentan then slides
               occasionally from the tip to the root of the N-terminal tail
               (ligand-sliding). During this sliding, bosentan passes the gate

               low-dimensional set of collective variables (CVs) {xi} = x that
               in some sense describe the essential dynamics of the system.
               Considering the distribution P(x) of the CVs, the primal goal of
               a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic features
               of P(x), in particular, its maxima and their connection paths.
               This is because these features characterize the low-energy
               regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding free energy
               landscape ΔG(x) = −kBT ln P(x), and therefore amount to the
               metastable states and transition regions of the system. In this
               perspective, we outline a systematic strategy to identify CVs and
               metastable states, which subsequently can be employed to
               construct a Langevin or a Markov state model of the dynamics. In

               ergodicity) and black-box software tools (e.g., using redundant

               (rather than Cartesian) input coordinates, employ dimensionality
               reduction methods that avoid rescaling errors (such as principal
               component analysis), and perform density based (rather than

               Computational models for interpreting the quantitative

               protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics based on protein

               principle can provide a more rational basis for structure-based

               deriving such QSKR models are rather limited in sample size and
               structural diversity. To tackle this problem, we have compiled a
               set of 680 protein-ligand complexes with experimental
               dissociation rate constants (k off), which were mainly curated
               from the references accumulated for updating our PDBbind

               complex in this data set was either retrieved from the Protein

               dissociation kinetic constants (k off) spanning nearly 10 orders

               structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results
               of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential
               energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the
               original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the
               density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P
               potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in
               good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord
               with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is
               poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are
               similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the
               discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in
               processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected
               in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion
               coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.
               Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable
               structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and
               they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The
               simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also
               attractive from a computational standpoint.",

               Cl(-), Br(-), and I(-)) ions play an important role in many
               biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of
               biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to
               key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To
               properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic
               simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding,
               catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of
               the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs
               to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including
               their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the
               interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in
               solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At
               present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple
               additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic
               interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build
               better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise
               Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are
               tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald
               simulations with specific choices of well-known water models.
               Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate
               treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and
               polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even
               a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the
               limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model
               could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be
               extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our
               starting point centered on observations from long simulations of
               biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where
               salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The
               likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to
               the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with
               AMBER-adapted Aqvist cation parameters. To provide a more
               appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the
               Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of
               water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we
               calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also
               lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide
               salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans
               across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while
               balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair
               combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization
               across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations.
               The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were
               targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and
               nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4P EW, and
               SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal
               properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding
               energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first
               hydration shells.",

               areas of biology, yet their properties remain elusive. Previous
               studies have analysed specific genes, often using their function
               as a proxy for fitness, experimentally assessing the effect on
               function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific
               sequence or in different sequences. However, systematic
               high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an
               entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an
               extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green
               fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring
               the native function (fluorescence) of tens of thousands of
               derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness landscape
               of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single
               mutation showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives
               with four mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The
               narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to
               30\% of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly occurred
               through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations
               causing a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a
               concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence
               divergence spanning hundreds of millions of years predicted the
               extent of epistasis in our data, indicating congruence between
               the fitness landscape properties at the local and global scales.
               The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has
               important implications for several fields including molecular

               of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation.
               Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide
               an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of

               hardware and algorithms. In drug discovery and development,
               computational studies can reduce the costs and risks of bringing
               a new medicine to market. Computational simulations are mainly
               used to optimize promising new compounds by estimating their
               binding affinity to proteins. This is challenging due to the
               complexity of the simulated system. To assess the present and
               future value of simulation for drug discovery, we review key
               applications of advanced methods for sampling complex free-energy
               landscapes at near nonergodicity conditions and for estimating
               the rate coefficients of very slow processes of pharmacological
               interest. We outline the statistical mechanics and computational
               background behind this research, including methods such as
               steered molecular dynamics and metadynamics. We review recent

               all-atom protein models and an explicit solvent, free-energy

               nearly 60 amino-acid residues, protein-ligand interactions, and
               coupled folding and binding of intrinsically disordered proteins.
               Recent progress in conformational sampling and its applications
               to biophysical systems are reviewed in this report, including
               descriptions of several outstanding studies. In addition, an
               algorithm and detailed procedures used for multicanonical
               sampling are presented along with the methodology of adaptive
               umbrella sampling. Both methods control the simulation so that
               low-probability regions along a reaction coordinate are sampled
               frequently. The reaction coordinate is the potential energy for
               multicanonical sampling and is a structural identifier for

               transitions among distinct stable states, but this study examines
               the enhanced conformational sampling of a simple system and shows
               that reasonably well-controlled sampling slows the transitions.
               This slowing is induced by a rapid change of entropy along the
               reaction coordinate. We then provide a recipe to speed up the
               sampling by loosening the rapid change of entropy. Finally, we

               production of non-target products (byproducts) causes adverse
               effects such as increased processing costs for purification and
               the amount of raw material. Thus it is required the development
               of modified enzymes to reduce the amount of byproducts'

               site prediction for enhancing the regioselectivity of substrate
               reaction sites (MSPER). MSPER takes conformational data for
               docking poses of an enzyme and a substrate as input and
               automatically generates a ranked list of mutation sites to
               destabilize docking poses for byproducts while maintaining those
               for target products in silico. We applied MSPER to the enzyme

               results indicate that MSPER can distinguish differences of
               substrate structures and the reaction sites, and can accurately
               predict mutation sites to enhance regioselectivity without

                   propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target

                   sequence of deterministic invertible functions and stochastic

                   expressivity limitations of normalizing flows resulting from
                   the invertibility constraint, whereas trainable
                   transformations between sampling steps improve efficiency of
                   pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas from

                   compute exact importance weights without having to

               AlphaFold, a deep learning-based approach to protein structure
               prediction, shows remarkable success in independent assessments
               of prediction accuracy. A significant epoch in structural
               bioinformatics was the structural annotation of over 98\% of
               protein sequences in the human proteome. Interestingly, many
               predictions feature regions of very low confidence, and these
               regions largely overlap with intrinsically disordered regions
               (IDRs). That over 30\% of regions within the proteome are
               disordered is congruent with estimates that have been made over
               the past two decades, as intense efforts have been undertaken to
               generalize the structure-function paradigm to include the
               importance of conformational heterogeneity and dynamics. With
               structural annotations from AlphaFold in hand, there is the
               temptation to draw inferences regarding the ``structures'' of
               IDRs and their interactomes. Here, we offer a cautionary note

               important, half of the regions in the human proteome are
               currently left with no SD assignments. These unassigned regions
               consist not only of novel SDs, but also of intrinsically
               disordered (ID) regions since proteins, especially those in
               eukaryotes, generally contain a significant fraction of ID
               regions. As ID regions can be inferred from amino acid sequences,
               a method that combines SD and ID region assignments can determine
               the fractions of SDs and ID regions in any proteome. RESULTS: In
               contrast to other available ID prediction programs that merely
               identify likely ID regions, the DICHOT system we previously
               developed classifies the entire protein sequence into SDs and ID
               regions. Application of DICHOT to the human proteome revealed
               that residue-wise ID regions constitute 35\%, SDs with similarity
               to PDB structures comprise 52\%, while SDs with no similarity to
               PDB structures account for the remaining 13\%. The last group
               consists of novel structural domains, termed cryptic domains,
               which serve as good targets of structural genomics. The DICHOT
               method applied to the proteomes of other model organisms
               indicated that eukaryotes generally have high ID contents, while
               prokaryotes do not. In human proteins, ID contents differ among
               subcellular localizations: nuclear proteins had the highest
               residue-wise ID fraction (47\%), while mitochondrial proteins
               exhibited the lowest (13\%). Phosphorylation and O-linked
               glycosylation sites were found to be located preferentially in ID
               regions. As O-linked glycans are attached to residues in the
               extracellular regions of proteins, the modification is likely to
               protect the ID regions from proteolytic cleavage in the
               extracellular environment. Alternative splicing events tend to
               occur more frequently in ID regions. We interpret this as
               evidence that natural selection is operating at the protein level
               in alternative splicing. CONCLUSIONS: We classified entire
               regions of proteins into the two categories, SDs and ID regions
               and thereby obtained various kinds of complete genome-wide
               statistics. The results of the present study are important basic

               First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate
               the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and
               appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second,

               For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed
               a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small
               to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR\_3

               protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)
               represents the first required step for cellular entry. SARS-CoV-2
               has continued to evolve with the emergence of several novel
               variants, and amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated
               with increased fitness and potential for immune evasion. Reliably
               predicting the effect of amino acid changes on the ability of the
               RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 can help assess the
               implications for public health and the potential for spillover
               and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step
               framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular
               dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect
               binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der
               Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born solvation, hydrogen bonding,
               π-π packing, and self-contact correction terms. The second step
               implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively
               predict binding affinity changes using the decomposed energy
               terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves a
               validation accuracy of 82.8\% for classifying single-amino acid
               substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving
               binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.73
               between predicted and experimentally calculated changes in
               binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a fivefold
               cross-validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for
               screening binding affinity changes caused by unknown single- and
               multiple-amino acid changes offering a valuable tool to predict
               host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward tighter hACE2

               only capture amino acid conservation but also more complex

               notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the

               written to straddle the worlds of physical chemistry and the life
               sciences and to show students how the tools of physical chemistry
               can elucidate and illuminate biological questions. Opening with a
               suite of chapters on Biochemical Thermodynamics, with a focus on
               energy conversion in biological cells and the factors that
               stabilize proteins, nucleic acids, and cell membranes, the book
               goes on to explore the Kinetics of Life Processes, examining the
               rates of chemical reactions, how rates can help characterise the
               mechanism of a reaction, and how enzymes affect reaction rates. A
               third section, Biomolecular Structure, looks at how concepts of
               physical chemistry can be used to establish those 'rules' that
               govern the assembly of complex biological structures, while the
               final section, Biomolecular Spectroscopy, describes the major
               techniques in biochemistry that are being applied to help us to
               explore biochemical processes and systems ever further. Physical
               Chemistry for the Life Sciences places emphasis on clear
               explanations of difficult concepts, with an eye toward building
               insight into biochemical phenomena. An extensive range of
               learning features, including worked examples, illustrations,
               self-tests, and case studies, support student learning
               throughout, while special attention is given to providing
               extensive help to students with those mathematical concepts and
               techniques that are so central to a sound understanding of
               physical chemistry. Balancing clarity and rigor of exposition of
               basic concepts with extensive discussion of biological techniques
               and processes, Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences is the
               perfect resource for every life science student who seeks to
               master those essentials of physical chemistry that underpin life
               itself. Online Resource Centre For students: - Web links for each
               chapter, pointing students to interesting sources of related
               information and data, to facilitate self-directed learning - A

                   collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins,
                   one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely
                   overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be
                   attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and
                   heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this
                   gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D
                   protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank
                   (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical
                   properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset,
                   Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each
                   subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
                   lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes.
                   Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical
                   properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential
                   and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the
                   simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals
                   throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we
                   evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for
                   the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value
                   of integrating richer physical properties in the study of
                   protein dynamics and related model design, we base our
                   approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these
                   physical properties into the trajectory prediction process.
                   Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward

                   a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation
                   energy) from the generated crystal structures. During

               and can pose a significant challenge in the identification of
               potential binding sites. Cryptic binding sites have been defined
               as sites which require significant rearrangement of the protein
               structure to become physically accessible to a ligand.
               Mixed-solvent MD (MixMD) is a computational protocol which maps
               the surface of the protein using molecular dynamics (MD) of the
               unbound protein solvated in a 5\% box of probe molecules with
               explicit water. This method has successfully identified known
               active and allosteric sites which did not require reorganization.
               In this study, we apply the MixMD protocol to identify known
               cryptic sites of 12 proteins characterized by a wide range of
               conformational changes. Of these 12 proteins, three require
               reorganization of side chains, five require loop movements, and
               four require movement of more significant structures such as
               whole helices. In five cases, we find that standard MixMD
               simulations are able to map the cryptic binding sites with at
               least one probe type. In two cases (guanylate kinase and TIE-2),
               accelerated MD, which increases sampling of torsional angles, was
               necessary to achieve mapping of portions of the cryptic binding
               site missed by standard MixMD. For more complex systems where
               movement of a helix or domain is necessary, MixMD was unable to
               map the binding site even with accelerated dynamics, possibly due
               to the limited timescale (100 ns for individual simulations). In
               general, similar conformational dynamics are observed in
               water-only simulations and those with probe molecules. This could
               imply that the probes are not driving opening events but rather
               take advantage of mapping sites that spontaneously open as part
               of their inherent conformational behavior. Finally, we show that
               docking to an ensemble of conformations from the standard MixMD
               simulations performs better than docking the apo crystal
               structure in nine cases and even better than half of the bound
               crystal structures. Poorer performance was seen in docking to
               ensembles of conformations from the accelerated MixMD

               However, cryptic pocket openings are often beyond the reach of
               conventional biomolecular simulations because certain cryptic
               pocket openings involve slow motions. Here, we investigate
               whether AlphaFold can be used to accelerate cryptic pocket
               discovery either by generating structures with open pockets
               directly or generating structures with partially open pockets
               that can be used as starting points for simulations. We use
               AlphaFold to generate ensembles for 10 known cryptic pocket
               examples, including five that were deposited after AlphaFold's
               training data were extracted from the PDB. We find that in 6 out
               of 10 cases AlphaFold samples the open state. For plasmepsin II,
               an aspartic protease from the causative agent of malaria,
               AlphaFold only captures a partial pocket opening. As a result, we
               ran simulations from an ensemble of AlphaFold-generated
               structures and show that this strategy samples cryptic pocket
               opening, even though an equivalent amount of simulations launched
               from a ligand-free experimental structure fails to do so. Markov
               state models (MSMs) constructed from the AlphaFold-seeded
               simulations quickly yield a free energy landscape of cryptic

               protein targets crystallized without a ligand and only become
               visible crystallographically upon binding events. These sites
               have been shown to be druggable and might provide a rare
               opportunity to target difficult proteins. However, due to their
               hidden nature, they are difficult to find through experimental
               screening. Computational methods based on atomistic molecular
               simulations remain one of the best approaches to identify and
               characterize cryptic binding sites. However, not all methods are
               equally efficient. Some are more apt at quickly probing protein
               dynamics but do not provide thermodynamic or druggability

               (lDDT) is a superposition-free score that evaluates local
               distance differences of all atoms in a model, including
               validation of stereochemical plausibility. The reference can be a
               single structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. We

               physical system. For the purpose of investigating the physical
               system under fluctuating temperature, we have introduced a
               coupled Nose–Hoover equation in our previous work (Fukuda and
               Moritsugu 2015 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48 455001). The coupled
               NH equation implements a fluctuating heat-bath temperature in the

               NH equation, the heat-bath temperature is a dynamical variable.
               The temperature fluctuations are not ad hoc, but instead are
               generated by the newly defined temperature system, and the

                   Recently, significant progress has been achieved with machine
                   learning approaches, especially with deep generative models.
                   Inspired by the diffusion process in classical
                   non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will
                   diffuse from original states to a noise distribution, in this
                   paper, we propose a novel generative model named GeoDiff for
                   molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff treats each atom
                   as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion
                   process (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to
                   stable conformations) as a Markov chain. Modeling such a
                   generation process is however very challenging as the
                   likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational
                   invariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving
                   with equivariant Markov kernels can induce an invariant
                   distribution by design, and further propose building blocks
                   for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable equivariance
                   property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in
                   an end-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational
                   lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood. Experiments on
                   multiple benchmarks show that GeoDiff is superior or

                   timesteps on the order of femtoseconds
                   ($1\textrm{fs}=10^{-15}\textrm{s}$). MD is often used to
                   compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling from
                   an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann
                   distribution. However, many important processes, such as
                   binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds or
                   beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with conventional
                   MD. Furthermore, new MD simulations need to be performed for
                   each molecular system studied. We present Timewarp, an

  abstract      = "Molecular dynamics (MD) has long been the de facto choice for
                   simulating complex atomistic systems from first principles.
                   Recently deep learning models become a popular way to
                   accelerate MD. Notwithstanding, existing models depend on
                   intermediate variables such as the potential energy or force
                   fields to update atomic positions, which requires additional
                   computations to perform back-propagation. To waive this
                   requirement, we propose a novel model called DiffMD by
                   directly estimating the gradient of the log density of
                   molecular conformations. DiffMD relies on a score-based
                   denoising diffusion generative model that perturbs the
                   molecular structure with a conditional noise depending on
                   atomic accelerations and treats conformations at previous
                   timeframes as the prior distribution for sampling. Another
                   challenge of modeling such a conformation generation process
                   is that a molecule is kinetic instead of static, which no
                   prior works have strictly studied. To solve this challenge,
                   we propose an equivariant geometric Transformer as the score
                   function in the diffusion process to calculate corresponding
                   gradients. It incorporates the directions and velocities of
                   atomic motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel
                   representations. With multiple architectural improvements, we

               SMLM resolution goes beyond the diffraction limit of light
               microscopy and achieves resolution on the order of 10-20 nm. SMLM
               thus enables imaging single molecules and study of the low-level
               molecular interactions at the subcellular level. In contrast to
               standard microscopy imaging that produces 2D pixel or 3D voxel
               grid data, SMLM generates big data of 2D or 3D point clouds with
               millions of localizations and associated uncertainties. This
               unprecedented breakthrough in imaging helps researchers employ
               SMLM in many fields within biology and medicine, such as studying
               cancerous cells and cell-mediated immunity and accelerating drug
               discovery. However, SMLM data quantification and interpretation
               methods have yet to keep pace with the rapid advancement of SMLM

               biosignatures of various biological structures and functions. In

                   assumption has several high-dimensional limitations,
                   motivating a more concrete route toward even higher dimension

                   extending the theory to a broader family of noising

                   To theoretically ground this, we relax a key assumption in
                   (denoising) score matching theory, demonstrating that
                   distributions which are differentiable almost everywhere

               interactions are a challenging and time-consuming task because
               peptides are generally more flexible than proteins and tend to
               adopt numerous conformations. There are several benchmarking
               studies on protein-protein, protein-ligand and nucleic
               acid-ligand docking interactions. However, a series of docking
               methods is not rigorously validated for protein-peptide complexes
               in the literature. Considering the importance and wide
               application of peptide docking, we describe benchmarking of 6
               docking methods on 133 protein-peptide complexes having peptide
               length between 9 to 15 residues. The performance of docking
               methods was evaluated using CAPRI parameters like FNAT, I-RMSD,
               L-RMSD. RESULT: Firstly, we performed blind docking and evaluate
               the performance of the top docking pose of each method. It was
               observed that FRODOCK performed better than other methods with
               average L-RMSD of 12.46 Å. The performance of all methods
               improved significantly for their best docking pose and achieved
               highest average L-RMSD of 3.72 Å in case of FRODOCK. Similarly,
               we performed re-docking and evaluated the performance of the top
               and best docking pose of each method. We achieved the best
               performance in case of ZDOCK with average L-RMSD 8.60 Å and 2.88
               Å for the top and best docking pose respectively. Methods were
               also evaluated on 40 protein-peptide complexes used in the
               previous benchmarking study, where peptide have length up to 5
               residues. In case of best docking pose, we achieved the highest
               average L-RMSD of 4.45 Å and 2.09 Å for the blind docking using
               FRODOCK and re-docking using AutoDock Vina respectively.
               CONCLUSION: The study shows that FRODOCK performed best in case
               of blind docking and ZDOCK in case of re-docking. There is a need
               to improve the ranking of docking pose generated by different
               methods, as the present ranking scheme is not satisfactory. To

               willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various
               pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying
               on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94\% and 92\% of
               the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo
               and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the
               field, while being faster. CONCLUSION: Fpocket provides a rapid,
               open source and stable basis for further developments related to
               protein pocket detection, efficient pocket descriptor extraction,
               or drugablity prediction purposes. Fpocket is freely available

               presents a significant challenge to computer-aided drug design
               efforts. A striking example is provided by recent crystal
               structures of the p38 MAP kinase, where a 10A movement of the
               Phe169 side-chain creates a new binding site adjacent to the ATP
               binding site that is exploited by the diaryl urea inhibitor
               BIRB796. Here, we show that this binding site can be successfully
               and repeatedly identified in explicit-solvent molecular dynamics
               (MD) simulations of the protein that begin from an unliganded p38
               crystal structure. Ligand-docking calculations performed on 5000
               different structural snapshots generated during MD indicate that
               the conformations sampled are often surprisingly competent to
               bind the inhibitor BIRB796 in the crystallographically correct
               position and with docked energies that are generally more
               favorable than those of other positions. Similar docking studies
               with an ATP-binding site-directed inhibitor suggest that it may
               be possible to develop hybrid inhibitors that target both the ATP
               and cryptic binding sites simultaneously. Intriguingly, both
               inhibitors are occasionally found to dock correctly even with
               p38's ``DFG'' motif in the ``wrong'' conformation and BIRB796 can
               successfully dock, albeit infrequently, without significant
               displacement of the Phe169 side-chain; this suggests that the
               inhibitor might facilitate the latter's conformational change.
               Finally, two quite different conformations of p38's DFG motif are
               also sampled for extended periods of time during the simulations;
               these may provide new opportunities for inhibitor development.
               The MD simulations reported here, which total 390 ns in length,
               therefore demonstrate that existing computational methods may be
               of surprising utility in predicting cryptic binding sites in

                   enable these functions, biomolecules have evolved to drive
                   LLPS and facilitate partitioning into biomolecular
                   condensates. Determining the molecular features of proteins
                   that encode LLPS will provide critical insights into a
                   plethora of biological processes. Problematically, probing
                   biomolecular dense phases directly is often technologically
                   difficult or impossible. By capitalizing on the symmetry
                   between the conformational behavior of biomolecules in dilute
                   solution and dense phases, it is possible to infer details

                   of dense phases. The symmetry between dilute and dense phases
                   is found in the size and shape of the conformational ensemble
                   of a biomolecule - parameters that small-angle x-ray

                   technological advances have made it possible to accurately

                   regions at low enough concentration to avoid interference

               of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1-39), a protein which
               has a folding time of approximately 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular
               dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were
               used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to approximately
               40 micros for several temperatures and starting states. At a
               temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we
               observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent
               with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state
               simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate
               predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding
               rate (approximately 640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from
               the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of
               two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse
               mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000

               native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for
               macrostates with p(fold) > 0.5, suggesting beta(12) hairpin

               hypernets and propose categorizing hypernets based on five design
               criteria: inputs, outputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and

               activating lesions found in human cancer, and are generally
               associated with poor response to standard therapies. Efforts to
               target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to
               its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known
               allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in
               functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP
               hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the
               nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative
               nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an
               advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active
               GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules
               that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C).
               These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and
               therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic
               studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent
               in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding
               switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C)
               disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native
               nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing
               binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a
               new allosteric regulatory site on Ras that is targetable in a
               mutant-specific manner.",

               events, calls for methodologies that depart from the
               well-grounded framework of equilibrium statistical physics. One
               of the approaches toward the analysis of complex temporal data
               which has found applications in the fields of neuroscience and

               influential for the evolution of the entire system, thus
               providing insights into causal relations within the dynamic

               a long molecular dynamics trajectory depicting repetitive folding

               folding and unfolding. On the contrary, interactions between

               these findings clearly favor the concept of zipperlike folding,

                   particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward
                   implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have
                   traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually
                   do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach
                   high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures,
                   single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has
                   become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also
                   increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of
                   memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only
                   interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD
                   utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and
                   output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we
                   present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on
                   grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into
                   spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between
                   particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse
                   compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more
                   efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size
                   allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths.
                   This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient
                   implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures
                   like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm
                   future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to
                   molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of

               IDPs makes structural studies and their interpretation
               challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could address
               this challenge in principle, but inaccuracies in the simulation
               models and the need for long simulations have stymied progress.
               To overcome these limitations, we adopt a hierarchical approach
               that builds on the ``flexible-meccano'' model reported by Bernadó
               et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 17968-17969). First, we
               exhaustively sample small IDP fragments in all-atom simulations
               to capture their local structures. Then, we assemble the
               fragments into full-length IDPs to explore the stereochemically
               possible global structures of IDPs. The resulting ensembles of
               three-dimensional structures of full-length IDPs are highly
               diverse, much more so than in standard MD simulation. For the
               paradigmatic IDP α-synuclein, our ensemble captures both the
               local structure, as probed by nuclear magnetic resonance
               spectroscopy, and its overall dimension, as obtained from
               small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. By generating
               representative and meaningful starting ensembles, we can begin to
               exploit the massive parallelism afforded by current and future
               high-performance computing resources for atomic-resolution
               characterization of IDPs.",

                   flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By

                   diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path

                   conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting

               function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific
               disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug
               discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging,
               however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI
               interfaces are ``cryptic'': When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic
               sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily
               recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and
               chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites
               only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small
               molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better
               understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To
               this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of
               the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three
               SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)-which performs its

               any prior structural information about the ligands' binding. In
               multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable
               binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a
               protein-small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical
               to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the
               IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the
               IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound
               emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy
               perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished
               between the native and non-native IL2-small-molecule binding
               poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding
               simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool
               for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding

               binding sites play a crucial role in various domains, from
               fundamental research to biomedical applications. However, current
               prediction methodologies often rely on holo (ligand-bound)
               protein conformations for training and evaluation, overlooking
               the significance of the apo (ligand-free) states. This oversight
               is particularly problematic in the case of cryptic binding sites
               (CBSs) where holo-based assessment yields unrealistic performance
               expectations. RESULTS: To advance the development in this domain,
               we introduce CryptoBench, a benchmark dataset tailored for
               training and evaluating novel CBS prediction methodologies.
               CryptoBench is constructed upon a large collection of apo-holo
               protein pairs, grouped by UniProtID, clustered by sequence
               identity, and filtered to contain only structures with
               substantial structural change in the binding site. CryptoBench
               comprises 1107 structures with predefined cross-validation
               splits, making it the most extensive CBS dataset to date. To
               establish a performance baseline, we measured the predictive
               power of sequence- and structure-based CBS residue prediction
               methods using the benchmark. We selected PocketMiner as the
               state-of-the-art representative of the structure-based methods
               for CBS detection, and P2Rank, a widely-used structure-based
               method for general binding site prediction that is not
               specifically tailored for cryptic sites. For sequence-based
               approaches, we trained a neural network to classify binding
               residues using protein language model embeddings. Our
               sequence-based approach outperformed PocketMiner and P2Rank
               across key metrics, including area under the curve, area under
               the precision-recall curve, Matthew's correlation coefficient,
               and F1 scores. These results provide baseline benchmark results
               for future CBS and potentially also non-CBS prediction endeavors,

               KRAS and have shown they can predict known cryptic binding sites.
               Furthermore, we performed ligand-binding simulations of a known
               inhibitor (MRTX1133) to shed light on the nature of cryptic

               using the computational hot spot identification tool FTMap. The
               results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free structures
               generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As
               expected, regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average
               flexibility, and close to 50\% of the proteins studied here have
               unbound structures that could accommodate the ligand without
               clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each
               cryptic site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand,
               suggesting that binding may frequently involve an induced fit
               component. We additionally evaluated the structural basis for
               cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures.
               Cryptic sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound
               structure by intrusion of loops (22.5\%), side chains (19.4\%),
               or in some cases entire helices (5.4\%), but motions that create
               sites that are too open can also eliminate pockets (19.4\%). The
               flexibility of cryptic sites frequently leads to missing side
               chains or loops (12\%) that are particularly evident in low
               resolution crystal structures. An interesting observation is that
               cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of
               backbone segments with fewer than five residues, result only in
               low affinity binding sites with limited use for drug discovery.",

               experimental quantity containing information about solute-solvent
               interactions and protein hydration. We use a hydration-shell
               model to partition the partial specific volume into an intrinsic
               volume occupied by the protein and a change in the volume
               occupied by the solvent resulting from the solvent interactions
               with the protein. We seek to extract microscopic information
               about protein hydration and unfolding from experimental volume
               measurements without using computer simulations. We employ the
               idea that the protein-solvent interaction will be proportional to
               the surface area of the protein. RESULTS: A linear relationship
               is obtained when the difference between the experimental protein
               partial specific volume and its intrinsic volume is plotted as a
               function of the protein solvent-accessible surface area. The
               effect of using different protein volume definitions on the
               analysis of protein volumetric properties is discussed.
               Volumetric data are used to test a model for the unfolded state
               of proteins and to make predictions about the denatured state.
               CONCLUSIONS: The linear relationship between hydration-shell
               volume change and accessible surface area reflects the similar
               surface properties (fractional composition of nonpolar, polar and
               charged surface) among a diverse set of proteins. This linear
               relationship is found to be independent of how the solution is
               partitioned into solute and solvent components. The
               interpretation of hydration shell versus bulk water properties is
               found to be very model dependent, however. The maximally exposed
               unfolded protein model is found to be inconsistent with
               experimental volume changes of unfolding.",

               theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the
               physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular

               elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique.

               exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary
               nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures,

               made in understanding conformational preferences, the atomistic
               mechanisms driving these preferences remain unresolved. In this
               work, we show that the distributions of atomic overlaps between

              middle-sized flexible molecule, bosentan, to a GPCR protein, human
              endothelin receptor type B (hETB), a GA-guided multidimensional
              virtual-system coupled molecular dynamics (GA-mD-VcMD) simulation
              was performed. This method is one of generalized ensemble methods
              and produces a free-energy landscape of the ligand-receptor
              binding by searching large-scale motions accompanied with stably
              keeping the fragile cell-membrane structure. All molecular
              components (bosentan, hETB, membrane, and solvent) were
              represented with an all-atom model, and sampling was carried out
              from conformations where bosentan was distant from the binding
              site in the hETB’s binding pocket. The deepest basin in the
              resultant free-energy landscape was assigned to the native-like
              complex conformation. The obtained binding mechanism is as
              follows. First, bosentan fluctuating randomly in solution is
              captured by a tip region of the flexible N-terminal tail of hETB
              via nonspecific attractive interactions (fly-casting). Bosentan
              then occasionally slides from the tip to root of the N-terminal
              tail (ligand–sliding). In this sliding, bosentan passes the gate
              of the binding pocket from outside to inside of the pocket with
              accompanying a quick reduction of the molecular orientational
              variety of bosentan (orientational selection). Last, in the
              pocket, ligand–receptor attractive native contacts are formed, and
              eventually the native-like complex is completed. The
              bosentan-captured conformations by the tip- and root-regions of
              the N-terminal tail correspond to two basins in the free-energy
              landscape, and the ligand–sliding corresponds to overcoming a
              free-energy barrier between the basins.",

               resolution using a two-edge (Se, Br) multiwavelength anomalous

               a member of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases

               water molecules have also been located in the structure.

               there are 4 polypeptide segments in pre2 differing in

               beta-Lg is a lipocalin, like plasma retinol-binding protein, so
               that ligand association was expected to make use of the central
               cavity in the protein. However, an early crystallographic
               analysis and some of the more recent solution studies indicated
               binding elsewhere. We have now determined the crystal structures
               of the complexes of the trigonal form of beta-Lg at pH 7.5 with
               bound retinol (R=21.4\% for 7329 reflections between 20 and 2.4 A

               calyx in a manner similar to retinol binding in retinol-binding

               the lack of ligand binding to the orthorhombic crystal form also

              (also known as Tek) is an endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine
              kinase involved in both angiogenesis and vasculature maintenance.
              RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structure of the Tie2
              kinase domain to 2.2 A resolution. The structure contains the
              catalytic core, the kinase insert domain (KID), and the C-terminal
              tail. The overall fold is similar to that observed in other
              serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase structures; however, several
              unique features distinguish the Tie2 structure from those of other
              kinases. The Tie2 nucleotide binding loop is in an inhibitory
              conformation, which is not seen in other kinase structures, while
              its activation loop adopts an ``activated-like'' conformation in
              the absence of phosphorylation. Tyr-897, located in the N-terminal
              domain, may negatively regulate the activity of Tie2 by preventing
              dimerization of the kinase domains or by recruiting phosphatases
              when it is phosphorylated. CONCLUSION: Regulation of the kinase
              activity of Tie2 is a complex process. Conformational changes in
              the nucleotide binding loop, activation loop, C helix, and the
              C-terminal tail are required for ATP and substrate binding.",

              circulating FVIIa and its cell surface bound obligate cofactor,
              Tissue Factor (TF). Circulating FVIIa is nominally activated but
              retains zymogen-like character and requires TF in order to
              complete the zymogen-to-enzyme transition. The manner in which TF
              exerts this effect is unclear. The structure of TF/FVIIa is known.
              Knowledge of the zymogen structure is helpful for understanding
              the activation transition in this system. RESULTS: The 2 A
              resolution crystal structure of a zymogen form of FVII comprising
              the EGF2 and protease domains is revealed in a complex with the
              exosite binding inhibitory peptide A-183 and a vacant active site.
              The activation domain, which includes the N terminus, differs in
              ways beyond those that are expected for zymogens in the Trypsin
              family. There are large differences in the TF binding region. An
              unprecedented 3 residue shift in registration between beta strands
              B2 and A2 in the C-terminal beta barrel and hydrogen bonds
              involving Glu154 provide new insight into conformational changes
              accompanying zymogen activation, TF binding, and enzymatic
              competence. CONCLUSIONS: TF-mediated allosteric control of the
              activity of FVIIa can be rationalized. The reregistering beta
              strand connects the TF binding region and the N-terminal region.
              The zymogen registration allows H bonds that prevent the N
              terminus from attaining a key salt bridge with the active site. TF
              binding may influence an equilibrium by selecting the
              enzymatically competent registration.",

               Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of a nonpeptidyl
               small molecule, previously discovered by medicinal chemistry
               [Tilley, J. W., et al. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 7589-7590],
               which binds to the cytokine IL-2. The small molecule binds to the
               same site that binds the IL-2 alpha receptor and buries into a
               groove not seen in the free structure of IL-2. Comparison of the
               bound and several free structures shows this site to be composed
               of two subsites: one is rigid, and the other is highly adaptive.
               Thermodynamic data suggest the energy barriers between these
               conformations are low. The subsites were dissected by using a
               site-directed screening method called tethering, in which small
               fragments were captured by disulfide interchange with cysteines
               introduced into IL-2 around these subsites. X-ray structures with
               the tethered fragments show that the subsite-binding interactions
               are similar to those observed with the original small molecule.
               Moreover, the adaptive subsite tethered many more compounds than
               did the rigid one. Thus, the adaptive nature of a protein-protein
               interface provides sites for small molecules to bind and
               underscores the challenge of applying structure-based design
               strategies that cannot accurately predict a dynamic protein

               compound (IC50 = 6 muM) bound to a hot spot on IL-2 in a groove
               that is not apparent in either the unliganded protein or a
               complex between IL-2 and a weakly bound drug fragment. The
               affinity-optimized compound (IC50 = 0.06 muM), which has an added
               aromatic acid fragment, bound in the same groove as the lead

               aromatic acid which is unseen in the complex with the lead
               compound. Thus, the hot spot on IL-2 is highly dynamic, with the
               protein changing form at multiple sites to maximize packing for
               each compound. Binding-site rigidity is often thought to play a

               specific contacts between the small molecule and the protein are

               structure-based virtual screening of a chemical database
               containing 58,855 compounds followed by the testing of potential
               compounds for SARS-CoV M(pro) inhibition leads to two hit
               compounds. The core structures of these two hits, defined by the
               docking study, are used for further analogue search. Twenty-one
               analogues derived from these two hits exhibited IC50 values below
               50 microM, with the most potent one showing 0.3 microM.
               Furthermore, the complex structures of two potent inhibitors with
               SARS-CoV M(pro) were solved by X-ray crystallography. They bind
               to the protein in a distinct manner compared to all published
               SARS-CoV M(pro) complex structures. They inhibit SARS-CoV M(pro)
               activity via intensive H-bond network and hydrophobic
               interactions, without the formation of a covalent bond.
               Interestingly, the most potent inhibitor induces protein
               conformational changes, and the inhibition mechanisms,
               particularly the disruption of catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145),
               are elaborated.",

               VAs modulate immune functions, possibly via direct interaction
               with alternative targets on leukocytes. One such target, the
               integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), has

               interaction at an atomic level. Here, we describe the crystal
               structure of the LFA-1 ligand-binding domain (I domain) in

               modulation of protein function by isoflurane, as demonstrated for

               nanomaterials that have many therapeutic applications, including
               drug delivery and biomedical engineering, due to their low
               cytotoxicity and higher uptake by targeted cells owing to their
               high affinity and specificity towards cell surface receptors.
               Despite the promising implications of this rapidly expanding
               field, there is no dedicated resource to study peptide
               nanostructures. This study endeavours to create a repository of
               short peptides, which may prove to be the best models to study
               ordered nanostructures formed by peptide self-assembly. SAPdb has
               a repertoire of 1049 entries of experimentally validated
               nanostructures formed by the self-assembly of small peptides. It
               consists of 328 tripeptides, 701 dipeptides, and 20 single amino
               acids with some conjugate partners. Each entry encompasses
               comprehensive information about the peptide, such as chemical
               modifications, the type of nanostructure formed, experimental
               conditions like pH, temperature, solvent required for the
               self-assembly, etc. Our analysis indicates that peptides
               containing aromatic amino acids favour the formation of
               self-assembling nanostructures. Additionally, we observed that
               these peptides form different nanostructures under different
               experimental conditions. SAPdb provides this comprehensive
               information in a hassle-free tabulated manner at a glance.
               User-friendly browsing, searching, and analysis modules have been
               integrated for easy data retrieval, data comparison, and
               examination of properties. We anticipate SAPdb to be a valuable
               repository for researchers engaged in the burgeoning arena of
               nanobiotechnology. It is freely available at

              importance, some binding sites, called cryptic binding (CB) sites,
              are not always readily apparent in the absence of ligands. The
              identification of CB sites from protein structures remains
              challenging, and no standard method has been proposed for this
              purpose. In this study, inspired by the observation of X-ray
              protein structures with noble gases, particularly xenon, I
              evaluate a xenon-based CB site identification strategy from their
              apo states. I performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
              of apo proteins with known CB sites in the presence of xenons. The

              only apparent binding sites but also CB sites, implying that they

              important targets for drug discovery. However, it is still
              difficult to correctly predict cryptic sites. Therefore, we
              introduce a new method, CrypToth, for the precise identification
              of cryptic sites utilizing the persistent homology method. This
              method integrates topological data analysis and mixed-solvent
              molecular dynamics (MSMD) simulations. To identify hotspots
              corresponding to cryptic sites, we conducted MSMD simulations
              using six probes with different chemical properties: benzene,
              isopropanol, phenol, imidazole, acetonitrile, and ethylene glycol.
              Subsequently, we applied our topological data analysis method to
              rank hotspots based on the possibility of harboring cryptic sites.
              Evaluation of CrypToth using nine target proteins containing
              well-defined cryptic sites revealed its superior performance
              compared to recent machine-learning methods. As a result, in 7 out
              of 9 cases, hotspots associated with cryptic sites were ranked
              highest. CrypToth can explore hotspots on the protein surface
              favorable to ligand binding using MSMD simulations with six
              different probes and then identify hotspots corresponding to
              cryptic sites by assessing the protein’s conformational
              variability using the topological data analysis. This synergistic
              approach facilitates the prediction of cryptic sites with high

               in order to calculate the binding free energies of Xe, Kr and Ar
               relative to a standard state at a pressure of 1 bar. A single
               bound Xe is found to assume an equilibrium distribution over
               three adjacent preferred sites, while in a two-Xe complex, the
               two Xe atoms preferentially occupy two of these. The positions of
               the three sites agree closely with the positions of bound Xe
               determined in the refined crystal structure of a complex formed
               at a pressure of 8 bar Xe, and the calculated affinities agree
               well with the observed partial occupancies. At a pressure of 8
               bar, a mixture of one-Xe and two-Xe complexes is present, and

               leads to the conclusion that binding of Xe within cavities in
               proteins is common because of several favorable factors: (1) Xe
               has a large atomic polarizability; (2) Xe can be applied at a
               relatively high pressure, i.e. high chemical potential; (3) an
               unfavorable entropic term related to the need to orient the
               ligand in the binding site is absent. Finally, it is found that
               the model's binding energy of a water molecule in the cavity is
               insufficient to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy.",

               cavities of varying size and shape. Even though the volumes of
               these cavities range up to the equivalent of five xenon atoms,
               the noble gases bind preferentially at highly localized sites
               that appear to be defined by constrictions in the walls of the
               cavities, coupled with the relatively large radii of the noble
               gases. The cavities within pseudo wild-type and L121A lysozymes
               each bind only a single atom of noble gas, while the cavities
               within mutants L133A and F153A have two independent binding
               sites, and the L99A cavity has three interacting sites. The
               binding of noble gases within two double mutants was studied to
               characterize the additivity of binding at such sites. In general,
               when a cavity in a protein is created by a ``large-to-small''
               substitution, the surrounding residues relax somewhat to reduce
               the volume of the cavity. The binding of xenon and, to a lesser
               degree, krypton and argon, tend to expand the volume of the
               cavity and to return it closer to what it would have been had no
               relaxation occurred. In nearly all cases, the extent of binding
               of the noble gases follows the trend xenon>krypton>argon.
               Pressure titrations of the L99A mutant have confirmed that the
               crystallographic occupancies accurately reflect fractional
               saturation of the binding sites. The trend in noble gas affinity
               can be understood in terms of the effects of size and
               polarizability on the intermolecular potential. The plasticity of
               the protein matrix permits repulsion due to increased ligand size
               to be more than compensated for by attraction due to increased
               ligand polarizability. These results have implications for the
               mechanism of general anesthesia, the migration of small ligands
               within proteins, the detection of water molecules within apolar
               cavities and the determination of crystallographic phases.",

              simulations using six chemically diverse probes (benzene,
              dimethyl-ether, phenol, methyl-imidazole, acetonitrile, and
              ethylene glycol). A machine learning model then ranks these
              hotspots based on their likelihood of being cryptic sites,
              incorporating both hotspot-derived and protein-specific features.
              Evaluation on a curated dataset demonstrated that CrypTothML
              outperforms recent machine learning-based methods, achieving an
              AUC-ROC of 0.88 and successfully identifying cryptic sites missed
              by other methods. Additionally, CrypTothML ranked cryptic sites as
              the top prediction more frequently than existing methods. This
              approach provides a powerful strategy for accelerating drug
              discovery and designing allosteric drugs.",

               production, often remarkable material properties, and
               biocompatibility. Such structures have so far been almost
               exclusively obtained through self-assembly from aqueous solution,
               and their morphologies are determined by the interactions between
               building blocks as well as interactions between building blocks
               and water. Using the diphenylalanine system, we demonstrate here
               that, in order to achieve structural and morphological control, a
               change in the solvent environment represents a simple and
               convenient alternative strategy to the chemical modification of
               the building blocks. Diphenylalanine (FF) is a dipeptide capable
               of self-assembly in aqueous solution into needle-like hollow
               micro- and nanocrystals with continuous nanoscale channels that
               possess advantageous properties such as high stiffness and
               piezoelectricity and have so emerged as attractive candidates for
               functional nanomaterials. We investigate systematically the
               solubility of diphenylalanine in a range of organic solvents and
               probe the role of the solvent in the kinetics of self-assembly
               and the structures of the final materials. Finally, we report the
               crystal structure of the FF peptide in microcrystalline form
               grown from MeOH solution at 1 Å resolution and discuss the
               structural changes relative to the conventional materials

               of molecular recognition and self-association processes
               represents an important route to the design of new supramolecular

               including xenon and nitrous oxide, act are only beginning to be
               discovered. However, structural approaches revealed weak but
               specific protein-gas interactions. METHODS: To improve knowledge,
               we performed x-ray crystallography studies under xenon and
               nitrous oxide pressure in a series of 10 binding sites within
               four proteins. RESULTS: Whatever the pressure, we show (1)
               hydrophobicity of the gas binding sites has a screening effect on
               xenon and nitrous oxide binding, with a threshold value of 83\%
               beyond which and below which xenon and nitrous oxide,
               respectively, binds to their sites preferentially compared to
               each other; (2) xenon and nitrous oxide occupancies are
               significantly correlated respectively to the product and the
               ratio of hydrophobicity by volume, indicating that hydrophobicity
               and volume are binding parameters that complement and oppose each
               other's effects; and (3) the ratio of occupancy of xenon to
               nitrous oxide is significantly correlated to hydrophobicity of
               their binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that
               xenon and nitrous oxide obey different binding mechanisms, a
               finding that argues against all unitary hypotheses of narcosis
               and anesthesia, and indicate that the Meyer-Overton rule of a
               high correlation between anesthetic potency and solubility in
               lipids of general anesthetics is often overinterpreted. This
               study provides evidence that the mechanisms of gas binding to
               proteins and therefore of general anesthesia should be considered
               as the result of a fully reversible interaction between a drug
               ligand and a receptor as this occurs in classical pharmacology.",

               conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an
               integrated use of computational and experimental methods.
               Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for
               constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are
               highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches
               based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data
               have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating
               structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from
               limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations
               absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative
               model that achieves high levels of transferability for
               intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named
               idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural
               networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of
               protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel
               conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large
               dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed
               with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the
               expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability,
               idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test
               sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also
               demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational
               ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the
               importance of training set size for generalization. We believe

               dominated our interpretation of ligand binding in biological
               macromolecules. When binding-dissociation events are fast
               compared to conformational transitions, the rate of approach to
               equilibrium, k(obs), becomes diagnostic of conformational
               selection or induced fit based on whether it decreases or
               increases, respectively, with the ligand concentration, [L].
               However, this simple conclusion based on the rapid equilibrium
               approximation is not valid in general. Here we show that
               conformational selection is associated with a rich repertoire of
               kinetic properties, with k(obs) decreasing or increasing with [L]
               depending on the relative magnitude of the rate of ligand
               dissociation, k(off), and the rate of conformational
               isomerization, k(r). We prove that, even for the simplest
               two-step mechanism of ligand binding, a decrease in k(obs) with
               [L] is unequivocal evidence of conformational selection, but an
               increase in k(obs) with [L] is not unequivocal evidence of
               induced fit. Ligand binding to glucokinase, thrombin, and its
               precursor prethrombin-2 are used as relevant examples. We
               conclude that conformational selection as a mechanism for a
               ligand binding to its target may be far more common than
               currently believed.",

               The 2 limiting cases are the ``induced fit'' mechanism (binding
               first) or ``conformational selection'' (conformational change
               first). Described here are the criteria by which the sequence of
               events can be determined quantitatively. The relative importance
               of the 2 pathways is determined not by comparing rate constants
               (a common misconception) but instead by comparing the flux
               through each pathway. The simple rules for calculating flux in
               multistep mechanisms are described and then applied to 2 examples
               from the literature, neither of which has previously been
               analyzed using the concept of flux. The first example is the
               mechanism of conformational change in the binding of NADPH to
               dihydrofolate reductase. The second example is the mechanism of
               flavodoxin folding coupled to binding of its cofactor, flavin
               mononucleotide. In both cases, the mechanism switches from being
               dominated by the conformational selection pathway at low ligand

               wide range of conditions, a significant fraction of the flux
               occurs through both pathways. Such a mixed mechanism likely will
               be discovered for many cases of coupled conformational change and

               spherical probe can enter, but a large probe cannot. The radius
               of the large probes corresponds to the shallowness of pockets. We
               showed that each type of binding molecule has a characteristic
               shallowness distribution. In this study, we introduced
               fundamental changes to our previous algorithm by using a 3D grid
               representation of proteins and probes, and the theory of
               mathematical morphology. We invented an efficient algorithm for
               calculating deep and shallow pockets (multiscale pockets)
               simultaneously, using several different sizes of spherical probes
               (multiscale probes). We implemented our algorithm as a new
               program, ghecom (grid-based HECOMi finder). The statistics of
               calculated pockets for the structural dataset showed that our

               data augmentation using computational estimates by molecular
               simulation. However, this approach has been limited to predicting
               mutational effects on thermostability. Here, we present a new
               data augmentation method that combines molecular simulation with
               zero-shot prediction computed by protein language models. These
               computational estimates serve as 'weak' training data to
               supplement experimental training data. Our method dynamically
               adjusts the weight and inclusion of weak training data based on
               available experimental training data. This reduces potential
               negative impacts of weak training data while extending
               applicability to diverse protein properties such as binding
               affinity and enzymatic activity. Benchmark tests demonstrate that
               our method improves prediction accuracy particularly when
               experimental training data are scarce. These results indicate the
               capability of our approach to advance protein engineering and
               pathogenicity prediction in small data regimes.",

               a structural ensemble of the tau K18 fragment containing the four
               pseudorepeat domains involved in both microtubule binding and
               amyloid fibril formation. We assemble 129-residue-long tau K18
               chains with atomic detail from an extensive fragment library
               constructed with molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce a
               reweighted hierarchical chain growth (RHCG) algorithm that
               integrates experimental data reporting on the local structure
               into the assembly process in a systematic manner. By combining
               Bayesian ensemble refinement with importance sampling, we obtain
               well-defined ensembles and overcome the problem of exponentially
               varying weights in the integrative modeling of long-chain

               nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift and J-coupling
               measurements. Without further fitting, we achieve very good
               agreement with measurements of NMR residual dipolar couplings.
               The good agreement with experimental measures of global structure
               such as single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
               efficiencies is improved further by ensemble refinement. By

               microtubule-bound state to the extended conformations of
               disease-associated tau fibrils. RHCG thus provides us with an
               atomically detailed view of the population equilibrium between
               functional and aggregation-prone states of tau K18, and
               demonstrates that global structural characteristics of this

               sequences with evolutionary information has progressed in leaps
               and bounds. However, even with the latest deep learning methods,
               the modelling of a critically important class of proteins, single
               orphan sequences, remains unsolved. RESULTS: By taking a
               bioinformatics approach to semi-supervised machine learning, we
               develop Profile Augmentation of Single Sequences (PASS), a simple
               but powerful framework for building accurate single-sequence
               methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PASS we apply it to
               the mature field of secondary structure prediction. In doing so
               we develop S4PRED, the successor to the open-source
               PSIPRED-Single method, which achieves an unprecedented Q3 score
               of 75.3\% on the standard CB513 test. PASS provides a blueprint
               for the development of a new generation of predictive methods,
               advancing our ability to model individual protein sequences.
               AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The S4PRED model is available as
               open source software on the PSIPRED GitHub repository
               (https://github.com/psipred/s4pred), along with documentation. It

               These improvements aim to increase both the quality of

               coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes.
               Quality of annotations has been improved by systematically
               applying Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE)
               principles and reporting all the details of the experimental

               molecular simulations that can simultaneously achieve efficiency,
               accuracy, transferability, and scalability for diverse molecules,
               materials, and hybrid interfaces. A key step toward this goal has
               been made with the GEMS approach to biomolecular dynamics [Unke
               et al., Sci. Adv. 2024, 10, eadn4397]. This work introduces the
               SO3LR method that integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural
               network for semilocal interactions with universal pairwise force
               fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range
               electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. SO3LR is trained on
               a diverse set of 4 million neutral and charged molecular
               complexes computed at the PBE0+MBD level of quantum mechanics,
               ensuring broad coverage of covalent and noncovalent interactions.
               Our approach is characterized by computational and data
               efficiency, scalability to 200 thousand atoms on a single GPU,
               and reasonable to high accuracy across the chemical space of
               organic (bio)molecules. SO3LR is applied to study units of four
               major biomolecule types, polypeptide folding, and nanosecond
               dynamics of larger systems such as a protein, a glycoprotein, and
               a lipid bilayer, all in explicit solvent. Finally, we discuss
               future challenges toward truly general molecular simulations by
               combining MLFFs with traditional atomistic models.",

  abstract  = "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have revolutionized the
               modeling of biomolecular conformations and provided unprecedented
               insight into molecular interactions. Due to the prohibitive
               computational overheads of ab initio simulation for large
               biomolecules, dynamic modeling for proteins is generally
               constrained on force field with molecular mechanics, which
               suffers from low accuracy as well as ignores the electronic
               effects. Here, we report AIMD-Chig, an MD dataset including 2
               million conformations of 166-atom protein Chignolin sampled at
               the density functional theory (DFT) level with 7,763,146 CPU
               hours. 10,000 conformations were initialized covering the whole
               conformational space of Chignolin, including folded, unfolded,
               and metastable states. Ab initio simulations were driven by
               M06-2X/6-31 G* with a Berendsen thermostat at 340 K. We reported
               coordinates, energies, and forces for each conformation.
               AIMD-Chig brings the DFT level conformational space exploration
               from small organic molecules to real-world proteins. It can serve
               as the benchmark for developing machine learning potentials for
               proteins and facilitate the exploration of protein dynamics with
               ab initio accuracy.",
